<h2 id="toc_1">Director Update</h2>

<p>I am once again pushing for improvements to accessibility of systems used by state government. The OCIO has been responsive and wants language to use in procurement contracts to know about accessibility when procuring software and systems. I am going to be speaking at the Director&rsquo;s meeting next month to hopefully raise awareness as well. If you have any insights regarding the accesssiblity of state government technology, stories about how it effected your ability to do your job, or other   information to share, please let me know. Keri and I have also been fighting with IWD to try and bring real accessibility to workforce centers rather than just purchasing JAWS and a CCTV and checking off the box. If you or any of your clients have any experiences with acccessibility challenges   and workforce centers, please let me know. </p>

<p>I attended the Friends of the Library meeting this afternoon. The Friends asked the Library Team to  share about the experiences of the past two years. It was really great to hear again about how they not only moved quicly and innovated to keep from having any disruption in service but create new programs. I am really proud and appreciative of all their hard work.</p>

<p>Also, while I&rsquo;m at the appreciation station :) I do want to give a shout out to our Leadership Team. I had to leave town for a few days for my Grandpa&rsquo;s funeral. It&rsquo;s kinda hard as a Director to take off without much planning and not worry. I&rsquo;m a bit anxious by nature and the job doesn&rsquo;t help. But I really didn&rsquo;t worry. I felt really confident that Sarah, Helen, Keri, Karly, Cheri, Kim, and Janice would deal with whatever came up. It is really awesome to work with such competent,  professionals. Also an extra shout out to Keri for writing a great explanation of our accessibility concerns to the working group and making sure that didn&rsquo;t get passed over. </p>

<h2 id="toc_2">New JAWS Update Available</h2>

<p>From Wes: We continue to experience difficulty in Freedom Scientific notifying JAWS users about new updates and in automatically downloading them. That said, a new JAWS update is available. While connected to the VPN, you can get to it and install it by locating the J22 file in h:\users\commonground\jaws.  This month’s release includes a way to turn off features in Excel that cause JAWS to perform sluggishly; this is available in Quick Settings. Improvements have also been made in Office 365 as well as a keystroke to disable the letter navigation keys if they are interfering with a web application you are using. A command you may have overlooked is the JAWS Restart feature. If you press Insert_Space then the F4 key, JAWS will restart. This can help when Jaws is behaving oddly or if something doesn’t seem right.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Tip: How to know if you are properly connected to a network and VPN with JAWS</h2>

<p>From Wes: Most of us here at IDB have laptops now. If you press the key in JAWS JAWS Key Shift B, as in Battery, you will hear the status of your battery and the time remaining until it is empty. A few versions back, JAWS also started reporting network status along with the battery info. If you are on the road and properly connected, you would hear something like “Battery Level High, Battery 93 Percent, Wes’s iPhone Internet Access, Blind.State.Ia.Us, No Internet Access. That means you are properly connected. To everything even though blind.state says no Internet Access. Here in the building, you would know if you aren’t connected to Wi-Fi properly if it said “IDB, No Internet Access”. This is a good way to tell if your VPN went down or if there is something wrong with your network connection.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Holiday Tea Basket Auction</h2>

<p>From the Holiday Tea Committee:  We will be holding a basket auction fundraiser during the May All Staff Meeting.  If anyone would like to contribute items to these baskets (gift cards, specific items, etc.), we would love your contribution!  There will be three themed baskets:  Coffee, May Day, and Pets.  Please give your item(s) to the person coordinating the basket.</p>

<p>*Coffee basket - Janice Eggers<br>
*May Day basket - Sarah Willeford<br>
* Pets basket - Darren Lee</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Center Corner</h2>

<p>From Karly: Triangle Clangers:<br>
Jeff successfully completed a drop off today Thursday.<br>
Janice completed her picture frame on Monday.<br>
Ambrose finished his cutting board on Monday.</p>

<p>Reminders:<br>
Our next tour day is next Friday, April 29, so please get your RSVP&rsquo;s in no later than today, Friday April 22.</p>

<p>Ambrose is holding his cutting board that is 15 inches by 10 inches. It is made out of walnut with an inch and a half stripe of cherry wood running through the middle.</p>

<p>Sandy is holding her picture frame that she made out of oak and she stained it with a golden oak stain. The picture frame will hold a photo that is 8.5 by 11inches</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Wellness Tip of the Week</h2>

<p>From Denise: Tip #4 Tips to a Happier You - Spending just 20 minutes outside will create a positive mood, improve concentration and your working memory. Try this fun trick that works! When you walk, in every few steps you take, say thank you for what you are grateful for, as for myself, today I am grateful for water.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Quote of the Week</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t explain your philosophy. Embody it&rdquo; &ndash; Epictetus</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Joke of the Week</h2>

<p>A: What&rsquo;s the easiest way to get straight As? </p>

<p>A: Use a ruler.</p>

<h1 id="toc_10">April 14, 2022</h1>

<h2 id="toc_11">AR: Please Update Work iPhones</h2>

<p>From Wes: New iOS 15.4.1 Available:<br>
Apple has released iOS 15.4.1. This update fixes panning and alert issues for those using Braille displays and patches security holes. While not noted anywhere, it looks like Verizon services may have also been updated in this update as some of the version numbers are different when I look at them. If you are having phone reception issues and are out of date, this update may fix them. Please run this update on your IDB iPhone. You will need to be attached to a Wi-Fi network such as Guest, your home Wi-Fi, or a colleague’s work mobile hotspot. The update is found in Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update. While still on Wi-Fi, after the update completes, it would be a good idea to run Mobil iron Go. This is the app that looks like a blue “M” and is either on page 2 or 3 of your home screen. VoiceOver Users will find it listed as Mobile Iron Go. The only thing you need to do is to just open the app while on Wi-Fi and let it sit for a few minutes. This permits it to update if it needs to. Since it is a big app, it needs Wi-Fi to update.</p>

<p>## AR: Reminder about IDB Devices</p>

<p>In follow-up to the information shared previously, just a quick reminder of our policies regarding using IDB’s IT resources.  Also, need to change the password on your phone as well as computer. </p>

<p>0.17. “IDB’s IT resources” include all computer systems, tablets, phones, and associated software and functions; e.g., the Internet and Internet connections, email systems, and any IDB equipment connected to or used by such resources. </p>

<p>2.19 IDB staff are prohibited from using IDB’s IT resources and communication systems for personal social media purposes, entertainment, or personal business.</p>

<p>2.20 IDB employees may not use personal devices such as phones, laptops, or tablets for social media, entertainment, for personal business purposes while on work time. However, employees may use their personal equipment and resources on non-work time; e.g., lunch hour, or authorized breaks to engage in social media, entertainment, or personal business. Personal devices should never be connected to the IDB Wi-Fi network, but may be connected to the IDB guest network. IDB staff may use the idb-guest internet connection to stream music on their personal device during work time, if doing so does not interfere with their work performance.</p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Volunteers For Pre-ETS Workbased Learning Volunteer Events</h2>

<p>We are looking to put together a monthly series of volunteering opportunities  that incorporate pre-ETS workbased learning skills during the next school year. If you enjoy volunteering and/or setting up volunteer opportunities, please let me or your superviosr know. </p>

<h2 id="toc_13">Farewell and Thanks To Deanna Horn</h2>

<p>From Kim: A brief note to share that Deanna Horn has accepted a position with Department of Revenue so she will be leaving our division on Thursday, April 14 end of business day; about week earlier than we discussed as Revenue wants her to start work on Friday, April 15th. Deanna came from Department of Revenue to work for our IL Division several months ago so returning to Revenue will be familiar for her. We are grateful for her assistance and I wish to extend my deepest appreciation for all her help.</p>

<p>Please help me to wish her well in her position with Dept. of Revenue.</p>

<h2 id="toc_14">Center Corner</h2>

<p>From Karly: IL students have been with us this week and it&rsquo;s been great. Everyone seems to be learning a lot and our energy is high. This evening, Center students are hosting IL students for dinner. They are serving a delicious dinner of stuffed peppers and stuffed mushrooms, steamed veggies, garlic bread, and a fruit fluff salad.</p>

<p>Next Wednesday 4/20, Center students are heading to the airport for TSA training. We have done this several times in the past and are happy to be doing this training with our students again!</p>

<p>Our next Tour Day will be April 29, so please get your RSVP&rsquo;s in to me by next Friday 4/22 so Nami can have a correct amount of food for that day.</p>

<h2 id="toc_15">Reminder: Unwanted Furniture</h2>

<p>From Karly: Sounds like we have a plethora of file cabinets and old chairs in the building that are not being used. Please please do not toss them, but let us know by end of day this Friday if you are not using these items and let us know how many; we’ll do a count, take pictures of them and get them off your hands in the near future.</p>

<h4 id="toc_16">End of Required Section</h4>

<h2 id="toc_17">Shower for Helen and Enrique</h2>

<p>From Cindy: All IDB staff are invited to a shower for Helen and Enrique on Thursday 4/21 at 5:00 pm in the Assembly Room.

<li>wear sleep shades and use your cane. If you don&rsquo;t still have your cane or sleep shades, talk to Karly and she can help you find some loaners.</li>
<li>RSVP to the student one week ahead of the meal to mmake sure they can plan for the right amount of food.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_36">Tips on Receiving Feedback</h2>

<p>I read the below in and thought it might be useful to any of us having trouble receiving feedback from colleagues or supervisors:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This tip is not to help you deliver feedback, but rather for anyone who receives feedback—which is everyone. When someone gives us feedback, or tries to hold us accountable, or initiates a Crucial Conversation, we often instinctively defend ourselves, especially when the feedback is not delivered well. On our worst days, we hear the feedback and melt down in hurt, shame, or anger. That’s when it’s time to do what my friend Joseph Grenny suggests: retake your pen.</p>

<p>Think of your “pen” as the power to define your worth. When you hold your pen, you author the terms of your story: is your worth intrinsic to you or is it about how you look? Is it contingent on what you achieve or how many people admire you? Whoever holds your pen can compose the terms of your wellbeing. Some days you feel in full possession of your pen no matter what is happening; your personal security comes from an enduring sense of your innate worth and not from others’ opinions of you.</p>

<p>Other times it’s a struggle to hold onto your pen and stay anchored in your values amid a storm of feedback and opinions—especially when we believe that feedback threatens our psychological safety or worth.<br>
We can remind ourselves of our capacity to secure our own safety and define our own worth, even while seeking the truth in tough feedback we receive. It’s a personal process, but it’s the foundation of being able to show up strong in a feedback conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>from: &ldquo;My Younger Employees Won’t Accept Feedback. What Can I Do?&rdquo; by Justin Hale </p>

<p><a href="https://cruciallearning.com/blog/my-younger-employees-wont-accept-feedback-what-can-i-do/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=crucialskills&amp;utm_campaign=CS-20220330&amp;mkt_tok=MzEzLUxPVC00NDcAAAGDeo5PuVMr6wQHr97S09ANWieE8QknAcit8r7xYBaesgV1we1CXbWcMj0MtCKnGIZUHgwpwm_uIupWwVWknNp5eaWo8tAsnprD41xAc1Z1HiZx8g">https://cruciallearning.com/blog/my-younger-employees-wont-accept-feedback-what-can-i-do/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=crucialskills&amp;utm_campaign=CS-20220330&amp;mkt_tok=MzEzLUxPVC00NDcAAAGDeo5PuVMr6wQHr97S09ANWieE8QknAcit8r7xYBaesgV1we1CXbWcMj0MtCKnGIZUHgwpwm_uIupWwVWknNp5eaWo8tAsnprD41xAc1Z1HiZx8g</a></p>

<h2 id="toc_43">AR: Password Change Required Next Week</h2>

<p>From the IT Team: In preparation for an update, please change your passwords on March 29th or March 30th.  This needs to be done by the end of the day March 30th.  Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="toc_44">AR: Coffee Talk Format Change</h2>

<p>So I had a quandry this week. I was sent a personal note that someone wanted included in Coffee Talk. This was a bit of a thinker Just so folks know how I make decisions,  every time someone asks me if we can do somethihng, I run it through these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it good for clients/patrons?</li>
<li>Is it in alignment  with our philosophy?&ldquo;</li>
<li>&quot;Is it within laws, regs, policies, and procedures? If not, should it be? If it isn&rsquo;t but it should be, is it in our power and worth our time to make the changes?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How would this scale? What if everybody in the agency wanted to do the same thing?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is the benefit worth any extra work or time that it will take? Are the people who would get more work seeing it this way? If not, can I find a way to offset the extra work ?&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>So the rule is everybody is required to read Coffee Talk. Another rule is that emails to the IDB all staff list need to get sent to Coffee Talk instead of sent out as individual emails if at all possible. Ober the years I&rsquo;ve heard from folks wanting more personal things shared and I&rsquo;ve heard from folks wanting less. Everyone is busy and everyone&rsquo;s time is baluable. It is also true that we are a work family and we care about one another. I came up with a lot of competing values and arguments on both sides. So I decided to try the following, I don&rsquo;t know if it will scale yet, but ig it gets to where I can&rsquo;t keep up, we&rsquo;ll need to try something else.</p>

<p>IDB staff are required to read Coffee Talk to the &ldquo;End of Required Section&rdquo; header (level 4). Everything past that is optional. The items in the required section will be team and division updates, things that require action for a significant number of staff, etc.   </p>

<h2 id="toc_45">Accounting Cup:</h2>

<p>From Emily: I just want to make sure that folks know that accounting is doing this because I asked them to. We need to have paper copies of receipts because DAS says so. If I could, I would remove this requirement as I think it is a waste of time. However, if DAS says we need something and we don&rsquo;t have it, it could get written up in our audit. We have to have the hotel certificates because it is a state law that is designed to reduce human trafficing which is something we can all agree is important. So I understand that this is more work and nobody needs more work and it is frustrating, but  this is not accounting&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>From Cheri:We have had a few problems with Expense R£               eports for travel reimbursements.  Accounting is not receiving all the paper receipts.   To help you to remember to send in the paper receipts Accounting will not submit Expense Reports without having the physical receipts and paperwork in hand first.  The only exceptions to this are personal mileage and Uber/Lyft receipts where the receipt is only sent electronically.  We will hold on to Expense Reports for one week and then send the Expense Report back to the employee if we haven’t received their paperwork yet.  There will be a comment in the Expense Report stating that we need the paper receipts. It is still very important that you have your Expense Reports completely submitted within one month of travel to ensure that DAS will reimburse you. Also, please remember that we need hotel certifications from stophtiowa.org attached with your receipt.  Accounting will send back any reports with a comment if it is missing something.</p>

<h2 id="toc_49">IL Article</h2>

<p>The below is reprinted from the ICUB Bulletin. If you aren&rsquo;t subscribed, there is quite a bit of useful info that they put out each quarter. This time they asked for an update on IL. </p>

<p>Iowa Department for the Blind Report<br>
Emily Wharton, Director</p>

<p>As part of our SFY22 appropriation, Governor Reynolds and the General Assembly generously included funding for a seventh Independent living Rehabilitation Teacher (ILRT). Last fall, we happily announced that we hired Alyssa Munstermann to fill this role. Alyssa has recently completed her Blindness Empowerment and Independence Center Training and is now training with Kim and the IL teachers.<br>
Alyssa Munstermann will be accepting cases within Polk County based on her and Mark Edge’s caseload size. She will be assigned to counties south of Polk County to reduce Susan Howard’s regional area. These counties include Adams, Adair, Clarke, Decatur, Jasper, Lucas, Madison, Marion, Polk, which is shared with Mark Edge, Ringgold, Taylor, Union, Warren, and Wayne. In addition to sharing Polk County with Alyssa, Mark will be serving two counties to the west of Polk and three counties just immediately to the north and slightly north and west of Polk County. Susan serves most of southeast Iowa. Connie Mendenhall serves the eastern corridor. Kelsi Hansen serves the Northeast corner of the state and Lori Berglund covers much of Northwest and North Central Iowa. Monica Venesky serves the western and southwestern edge of our state.<br>
Alyssa grew up on a farm in Southwest Iowa and attended Iowa State. There she got the opportunity to study abroad for six months in London where she was able to travel all over Europe on the weekends. She settled in Des Moines and is married and has two young daughters, a kindergartener and a toddler. Her husband works for Hy-Vee and they have a dog named Lolo. She has worked for IDB for three and a half years now, so she&rsquo;s not new to the Department, but new to her position. Her work as IL support staff made her very familiar with IL&rsquo;s processes. Alyssa says, “I am really looking forward to getting out there and helping my clients become as independent as possible. I know how much having independence means to someone. It inspires me to look outside the box when problem solving against any obstacles that might keep them from getting a task done in their day-to-day life. I want to be that person that they can trust to help provide those tools and tricks to be successful on their own.&ldquo;<br>
We are also excited to welcome Julie Skinner to fill Alyssa&rsquo;s previous role as IL secretary. Julie worked for IDB several years ago as a temp and we were very excited to see her application for this position. She has just completed her Center training and is working with Kim to train on her daily job duties.<br>
It is a time of joy and excitement at IDB and in IL and Maintenance especially, as we recently congratulated Kim Barber and Randy Walford on their marriage. IL and the Center are busily planning the IL Integration that will be held from April 10 through April 15th.</p>

<h2 id="toc_50">Director Updates</h2>

<p>HF2575 was released and contains the full amount  requestded by IDB and supported by the Governor. Fingers and toes crossed it will stay this way through the signing of the bill.   </p>

<p>Attached is a summary of the changes to the manual that will be up by the end of the moth. If you have any questions, please let me or your manager know. <br>
I have started putting out the Director&rsquo;s Forum updates as a podcast. It can be found on our podcasts page on the website. Right now, it is just the updates I give and not the question and answer section. This might change if enough people want it to, but for now, it&rsquo;s just my updates.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_52">Personal Note</h2>

<p>From Ross <br>
Some may have heard that my family had a small house fire this last Friday. We’re all ok, but our kitchen has seen better days. A little Oops became an Oh No that became an Oh Crap. We have a temporary place arranged, but for now we’re in transition. I want to thank Matt Nemmers who opened up his home for us this weekend, and others on my team who have been accommodating and have offered assistance. And to Nami Wallace, if you happen to notice items missing from Home Management, it’s just a coincidence. Thank you, everyone.</p>

##Shout Out
I was thrilled to  receive the below from a client this week. </li>
</ul>

<p>Subject: Thank you</p>

<p>Dear Director Wharton, Teacher Lori and Staff of the Iowa Department for the Blind, When I contacted the IDB nearly two years ago, I did not know what to expect. From my first phone call to my final visit with Lori, I have been treated with kindness and determination to see my needs were met. Your service, the resources I received, the patient teaching, and support have been provided. Thank you for helping me learn to live with my loss of vision. You are the greatest. </p>

<h2 id="toc_60">IL Community Based Training Updates</h2>

<p>From Kim: Susan and Mark are planning 2 community-based trainings to be held the first week of April at the Department.  They will be held from 9:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. on April 5 and on April 7. They are hoping to get 5 or 6 participants each day.  The trainings will focus on meal preparation, cane travel, using an I-Phone and/or I-Pad, and business class.  Mark reserved the new Studio 320 to hold the CBTs. </p>

<h2 id="toc_62">Director Updates</h2>

<p>We received our RSA monitoring report on Monday. I discussed it at length at the Board meeting on Tuesday. I also asked folks to either email me questions or bring them to today&rsquo;s Director&rsquo;s Forum. We have already started on our Corrective Action Plan. It mostly inovolves updating policy. This is going to take a fair bit of time and energy from Keri, Cheri, Helen, and myself as well as others who work with quality assurance and data like Wes and Jamie. There will be trainings for all VR folks that we will conduct during Teamfests and within divisions also to comply with RSAs requirements.   </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see only one job posting below, but a couple of positions will be posted soon including a VRT. We would love help and ideas for ways to improve our promotion and recruiting for these positions. If you have any ideas, please send them to me.</p>

<h2 id="toc_76">Quote of the Week</h2>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.&rdquo; &ndash;Epictetus</p>

<p>A note about Epictetus: Epictetus, born ~50AD, was a disabled man born into slavery in Phrygia (present-day Turkey). Nothing that he wrote down survives; we know about him only through the words of other scholars. But he was so wise that his ideas reverberate through society today. <br>
Additionally, Albert Ellis (1913 - 2007) credited Epictetus with providing a foundation for his system of psychotherapy, underlining the prevailing relevance of Epictetus’s observationsEllis&#39; theory (R.E.B.T.) eventually became a major part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, the most evidenced-based therapy for treating mental disorders today</p>

<h2 id="toc_89">Wellness Tip of the Week</h2>

<p>Snack smarter. This week, pack healthy snacks to eat during the day. Eating a small snack (less than 200 calories) twice a day keeps your metabolism and blood sugar levels steady. You’ll be less tempted by unhealthy snacks at the office and you can save your calories for a weekly indulgence, like a slice of homemade pie at a party. </p>

Thank Jyou. </p>

<h2 id="toc_92">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Tim: just wanted to give a shout out for Marcella - I talked to a patron today (actually the spouse, the patron had recently passed) who told me when they called about our Library Services (last October) &ldquo;Marcella really lifted their spirits that day&rdquo;, and after the call they joking said to each other &ldquo;when we get depressed again, we should just call the Department f/t Blind and ask for Marcella!&rdquo; Good job Marcella!!</p>

<h2 id="toc_93">Director&rsquo;s Updates</h2>

<p>The Governor has signed the school funding bill so now our budget has gone to the Senate in SSB 3148. Hopefully there will be no surprise or differences in the House or Senate version from what the Governor is proposing in this bill. The General Assembly is ahead of where they have been in recent years, so this might mean a less stressful late spring for myself and Cheri and her team. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>We are moving the Training Resource Center (TRC)  down to the old Aids and Devices (fromerly Tyler&rsquo;s office) the first floor!  This will help us to have a mediu sized conference room on third floor and more convenience for tech staff and clients coming in for demos and assessments. Tyler has moved over to Jodi&rsquo;s office and Jodi has moved up to fourth floor with the machines.</p>

<p>This week, a news report ran regarding a FOIAed email I sent to the Governor&rsquo;s office. It was picked up, we think, incidentally to another FOIA request of the Governor&rsquo;s office pertaining to libraries or education. For three years, Sarah W. and I had been trying to address what we and the IMC team considered to be a serious concern regarding the data privacy of blind children served by Iowa Prison Industries. You can read the whole <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2022/02/16/state-agency-believes-prisoners-had-access-students-information-took-more-than-two-years-make-change/">story</a> on KCRG&rsquo;s website. As I told the Department of Education and the Governor&rsquo;s Office if I could have gotten a response any other way, I would not have gone to the Governor&rsquo;s Office. We went to talk to the DE in person initially to keep it from being in writing. We were told it would be fixed and it wasn&rsquo;t. I asked our AAG for assistance. I couldn&rsquo;t get DE to respond. We shared our concerns twice to the DE, IESBVI, and IPI in two statewide braille meetings. It was so maddening because it didn&rsquo;t need to happen. They didn&rsquo;t need to give the prisoners the full names, dates of birth, and addresses. They didn&rsquo;t need to release inmates with this information on the computer that IPI was selling them. It was all so unnecessary and potentially harmful and we could not make the Department of Education care enough to make it stop. As state employees, our names are kept from the prsioners making the furniture we order from IPI, but giving the names of students  was apparently acceptable. It was so frustrating and disheartening. This was extreemely stressful for Sarah and the IMC team. Having this knowledge and having to remain silent had to be so hard. Each time this came back, we were so frustrated.  We saw what was being given to the prisoners and We know these kids whose names were on the sheet and it felt like no matter what we did, we could not make those with the power to make the change care enough to ensure it was fixed  . I am sharing this because I need to lett you know how awesome Sarah, Jerry, Karen C.,Roxanne, and Denise were through all of this. I mean, they are generally awesome, but with this all going on they were dealing with more stress than they should ever have to in their jobs. We will always continue to strive to make sure that blind students in Iowa get high quality accessible materials in a timely manner. We have a good deal of evidence that shows IPI is not producing quality tactiles. The Department of Education has said that they are &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;.   </p>

<p>The Communications Team is putting together an ice breaker that will excite Harry Potter fans and help people who aren&rsquo;t Harry Potter fans know what the fans are talking about. We ask you to take one of the below quizes to find out which Hogwarts house you would be sorted into before the All staff meeting. You don&rsquo;t have to share this with anyone, just know which one you are for the activity.  sorry I ran out of time to test more quizes, but if folks know of other good quizzes that are accessible, please let me know. <br>
We have a couple of quiz options. <br>

We also have more info below to help those who might not be familiar with the houses.<br>
From Kayla: Sorting and Hogwarts house explanation<br>
When students first come to  Hogwarts to learn magic,  they are sorted into one of four houses. The houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. I’ve taken the following from Chapter 7 of Harry potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone for an explanation of the character traits found in each of the   houses.</p>

<p>“You might belong in Gryffindor,  Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;</p>

<p>You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil;</p>

<p>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind;</p>

<p>Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.” </p>

Tammy reported that probably the most valuable service IDB is providing to her right now is Terri’s Braille Group.  Tammy is a farmer’s wife and is pretty isolated on the farm.  She lost her vision suddenly to cancer and is still recovering, physically and mentally. Her husband and children are great supports to her, but she still feels isolated.  She reports that the interaction with others is so valuable to her and she looks forward to each and every class that Terri facilitates.  She’s getting to know the other participants and really enjoys this aspect of Terri’s group.</p>

<h2 id="toc_104">AR: Activity for All Staff Meeting</h2>

<p>The Communications Team is putting together an ice breaker that will excite Harry Potter fans and help people who aren&rsquo;t Harry Potter fans know what the fans are talking about. We ask you to take one of the below quizes to find out which Hogwarts house you would be sorted into before the All staff meeting.  sorry I ran out of time to test more quizes, but if folks know of other good quizzes that are accessible, please let me know. <br>
We have a couple of quiz options. <br>
If you know some about Harry Potter, this quiz is very good:<br>
<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/accurate-af-sorting-quiz">https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/accurate-af-sorting-quiz</a></p>

<p>This quiz requires no Harry Potter knowledge, and is accessible right up to the end where the results are show in a picture. So if you use a screen reader, you would want to send the result graphic to a reader to get the results from the graph:<br>

We also have more info below to help those who might not be familiar with the houses.<br>
From Kayla: Sorting and Hogwarts house explanation<br>
When students first come to  Hogwarts to learn magic,  they are sorted into one of four houses. The houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. I’ve taken the following from Chapter 7 of Harry potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone for an explanation of the character traits found in each of the   houses.</p>

<p>“You might belong in Gryffindor,  Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;</p>

<p>You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil;</p>

<p>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind;</p>

<p>Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.” </p>

<h2 id="toc_110">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Sarah B.: Shout out to Ross!  Ross is always coming up with creative ways to teach clients. I have the pleasure of being copied in on emails to clients that are entertaining and educational.

If they finish an assignment, BAM he send them another one. Thanks Ross and all the other teachers for your hard work.</p>

<h2 id="toc_111">AR: Do Not Update Your Computer To Windows 11.</h2>

<p>From Wes: Important: Stay on Windows 10 for Now<br>
This is our second reminder Please do not update to Windows 11. One way to safeguard yourself from inadvertently doing this update is to follow the below steps:<br>
Open Settings &gt; Update and Security.<br>
If your computer is ready for Windows 11, there will be a download and install button.<br>
Lower down on the screen and accessible with the tab key is a link that says “Stay on Windows 10 for Now”. Activate this link.<br>
From now on, you will be offered updates for Windows 10 only.<br>
As of 2/4/22, all Windows 10 updates that are available to you are safe to download.<br>
In future, when you check for updates, you will encounter a link that says “See if it is ready to install”.<br>
Do not activate this link<br>
Please reach out to Craig or me if you have questions about these steps as Windows 11 will not work with our systems at this time.</p>

<p>##If You Are Having Trouble With Logging Into Workday</p>

<p>Please share this with Craig. Please do not contact the OCIO. OCIO  doesn&rsquo;t  work with our computer login system and will  give you bad advice and make things worse. </p>

<h2 id="toc_112">Important If You Submit Travel Vouchers</h2>

<p>We learned through our RSA monitoring that not only is it state policy that travel vouchers need to be turned in within 30 days, when travel vouchers are not in by the end of the month they will not be obligated in the proper period of performance. This means that submitting a travel voucher  beyond thirty days puts our agency out of compliance with federal regulations. If this continues to be an issue, we will need to factor this into performance evaluations and/or disciplinary procedures in order to ensure compliance. Thanks for your help in getting your travel vouchers done on time and keeping us in compliance.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_113">Center Corner:</h2>

<p>From Karly: Our energy in the center right now is very positive and I am excited for our continued growth.  Everyone is working hard, and this is very exciting!</p>

<h3 id="toc_114">Triangle Clangers:</h3>

Congratulations to Josh who graduated yesterday, Thursday!  Josh will be pursuing schooling to be a Para-Educator.  I know Josh also has other goals he is working towards as well and we are excited for his bright future.<br>
As I write this, Jeff is preparing his second small meal which will be served at 12:30 today!  Jeff will be having shrimp fettuccine alfredo, tossed salad, corn bread, and homemade ice cream.<br>
Maria will also finish the braille code today!</p>

<p>##Director updates<br>
 Just a reminder that the all staff meeting will be virtual on Friday, February 25th. . The connection info is below and you should have gotten a calend invite as well. VR TeamFest will be in person in 2S. Teams will sit together for the entire meeting. </p>

<p>A big thanks to everyone who participated in the escape room food bank fundraiser. With donations, we were able to give $245 to the food bank. While no one excaped the room in time, the Library, the Center Staff, and the Center Students all were very close &ndash; each just missing one little piece to solve the whole thing. But most importantly the teams got to practice their communication, bond and have some fun. </p>

<p>We turned in our annual update to our Strategic Plan to the Department of Management this week and it is posted to our website. The WIOA state plan revisions are now out for public comment and there is a link to this on our website. A big thanks to Keri for all her work on this. </p>

<p>Following the survey and recommendation of the Client Staff Safety Workgroup, we are looking to get Crucial Conversations training for all staff. We tried getting this though DAS and while this was amusing and gave me a great idea for business class, it isn&rsquo;t going to work out. We&rsquo;ll be looking for a private vendor to provide this training.  </p>

<p>In the Communications Team, I shared some info regarding crucial conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with DAS around accessibility. I then found out about another thing we tried to help them with where they didn&rsquo;t follow through. If you have are asked to help out DAS or other state agencies with accessibility issues, please let me know and keep me posted on the progress. Some of these things I&rsquo;ve been working on since I got here over 8 years ago and at times I need to get pretty direct, so having current info and facts is super helpful. Thanks much for your help with this.</p>

<h2 id="toc_117">If You Work With College Students</h2>

<p>From Enrique:Microsoft Office often has contacts with thousands of institutions like LA tech Iowa state University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa DMACC and so on to offer Microsoft Office to all students and staff for free or at a drastically reduced price. So, if you have a student asking for Microsoft Office 365 please feel free to ask them to reach out to their institution first. Also, these colleges will often have help desks to help students get software and or services loaded in to their computers and mobile devices. Additionally this is often not just for Office but other software like Adobe Pro, Word Press, and even JAWS. Not to mention many institutions offer other entertainment apps and services like YouTube for free or reduced price, Spodify, Apple Music, Amazon and many more. All students have to do is ask their university’s student services office to see what may be available.</p>

<h2 id="toc_128">Thank You</h2>

<p>From Jodi: IDB Staff—<br>
Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers over the years for my daughter. Some of you have been there from the beginning of her journey and know how hard she fought. Your thoughts and heart felt condolences mean so much. Thank you for the card and contribution to the Cacy Hupp Memorial Fund as well. I’m truly lucky to work with a great group of people.</p>

<h2 id="toc_129">Director Updat</h2>

<p>Looking at the logistics and weiging  the benefits and drawbacks, I have decided to hold the February All Staff Quarterly meeting over Zoom. If things are then like they are now, putting our entire staff in one room seems unwise. I&rsquo;d really prefer to be in person, but hopefully we will be in May. </p>

<h2 id="toc_130">JAWS Update available</h2>

<p>From Wes: There is an issue with our computers talking to freedom Scientific to see when a JAWS update is available. While we are working on the issue and until it is fixed, the latest versions of JAWS 2021 and 2022 are available in the Common Ground folder under JAWS. If you run the Jaws 2022 file and it needs to be updated, the process will look the same as the automatic update. If you already have the current version and you run this file, it will ask if you want to repair JAWS. You do not need to repair JAWS unless instructed to do so or it is not working correctly. Updates come out around once a month; the current version in the folder is from mid-December.</p>

<h2 id="toc_131">AR: , updating Office 365 applications manually</h2>

<p>From Wes: The new Office 365 updates on a more frequent basis than the older versions of Office that we used in the past. While some of these updates happen automatically, it is necessary to manually start some of the updates. This would be a helpful item to check after you change your password, after you run Windows or screen reader updates,  or any time you notice Office acting differently than you would expect. Frequent crashing or oddities with Office and a screen reader signal that it might be time for an update of office and/or the screen reader.</p>

<p>Here is how to force Office to run updates:</p>

<p>Open your favorite Office app such as Word, Excel, or Outlook (the steps are the same regardless of the app you use.<br>
* Choose “Home” Then the Account Tab Then Update Options.; the fastest way to do this is with the keyboard shortcut Alt, Then F, Then D, Then R. Note than the word “Then means to press the key then let it go; so press the keys in sequence without holding them down.<br>
* Choose “Update Now”; the keyboard shortcut for this is “U”<br>
A colleague remembers this by remembering Alt, F, D, R, Update.<br>
If you hear “You’re Up to Date” followed by Close, you can choose the close button to get back to the app you were using.<br>
* If a window appears saying “Downloading Office Updates”, this means that Microsoft has some updates for the software and the process has begun. You can minimize this window with the Minimize button provided.<br>
It is safe to use the office apps while downloads are occurring.<br>
* Eventually, a window will appear saying that office apps need to be closed to finish installing.<br>
If apps are open, I usually manually close them so that I can save my work.<br>
* From the window that appears, choose “Continue”.<br>
A window appears saying “Applying updates”. Office apps should not be reopened while this is happening.<br>
Eventually, a window will appear saying “Updates were Installed.<br>
* Choose “Close” to dismiss the window.<br>
Note:Pressing “Continue” in the updates window with office apps open will automatically close those apps, but I have found that the documents that were saved and reopened after the updates can be unpredictable.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2 id="toc_132">Password Do&rsquo;s and Don&#39;ts</h2>

<p>From Sarah:  </p>

<h2 id="toc_133">Password ‘Do’s’</h2>

<ul>
<li>The best passwords are at least 10 characters and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (!@#$&amp;^%). The tougher the password, the longer it will take a brute force attack to guess your password.</li>
<li>Create a mnemonic device to remember your passwords. Your bank password could use a dollar sign and emoticons based on how you feel about it. Something like “RoLL!nG$inIT;)” is secure and can be remembered without too much hassle. Notice that this password isn’t actually a dictionary word, which makes it more difficult to hack.</li>
<li><p>Change your passwords often, at least every 30 days. If you are likely to forget, just set a reminder in your calendar or phone.</p>

<h3 id="toc_134">Password ‘Dont’s’</h3></li>
<li><p>Don’t use common words, especially your personal information or any word you can find in the dictionary.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use the same password in multiple places. If someone hacks your password on one site, your other accounts that use that same password become compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid common keyboard patterns like “qwerty” or “asdfg.”</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t recycle previously used passwords when you update your password.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The internet is a powerful tool that helps us all stay connected, do business and entertain ourselves. But like any tool, it can also be used to do harm. That’s why it’s important to stay educated and informed about how to keep yourself safe in online spaces. If you haven’t already updated your passwords to maximize your security, there’s no better time than now.</p>

<h2 id="toc_135">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Karly: Triangle Clangers:<br>
Maria completed her first small meal on Tuesday.  She served a mexican chicken with homemade sauce, spanish rice, a russian salad, and a fruit fluff salad.<br>
Alyssa finished her center training yesterday, Thursday.  She did great and her clients  are lucky to have her.</p>

<p>The center has had great energy and our students continue to learn and grow. We are having tour day today, the biggest one yet with 5 clients!  The students are serving lunch for them which will consist of spaghetti pie, zucchini salad, bread sticks, and apple crisp.</p>

<h2 id="toc_136">Retreat Updates</h2>

<p>from Hannah: October’s youth retreat was a fall themed extravaganza. Students made potions to reinforce science concepts. The students had a howling good time at the pumpkin patch. They participated in a hay ride, pumpkin picking and peddle go carts on a track. Once back at the department, students carved their pumpkins and feasted on Halloween and Harry Potter themed treats.</p>

<h3 id="toc_137">January Retreat</h3>

<p>From Ross: January 2022 Youth Weekend Retreat<br>
This weekend retreat thirteen students spent time training with various technological temptations with the top-notch tutelage of our technology specialist. They had opportunities to explore braille devices, smart phones, accessible gaming with screen readers, and some fun with Playgrounds. The students stimulated their minds with a sticky STEM activity by constructing a marshmallow tower with spaghetti noodles string, and tape. Everyone experienced the enigmatic escape room engineered by our executive director, Emily Wharton, the puzzle master, and they saved IDB from the Mad Bomber by using air tags to find the &ldquo;bombs&rdquo; hidden throughout the building. Saturday night students relaxed and watched Apollo 13 with audio description, but only after visiting the concession stand ran by our crabby counter clerks, Amena Thomas and Helen Stevens. Their crabbiness may or may not have been acting. Out of the thirteen, we had two new students, who were a bit hesitant and unsure when they arrived, but they seemed to enjoy themselves and look forward to further retreats or possibly the summer program. All in all, the youth weekend retreat was designed, compiled, computed, programmed, and executed successfully, and it could have not been done so without the hard work and dedication of YATP and the RTS&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2 id="toc_146">Joke of the Week</h2>

<p>What did the big flower say to the little flower? </p>

<p>Hi bud!</p>

<h1 id="toc_147">January 20, 2022</h1>

<h2 id="toc_148">Thank You</h2>

<p>From Denise: &ldquo;Thank you for the beautiful Remembrance figurine sent as a thoughtful gesture in my Mother-In-Law passing. It is a wonderful reminder of the incredible group of people I get to work with at IDB.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="toc_149">AR: Final reminder on ongoing issues</h2>

<p>Here are 3 things I&rsquo;ve talked about before. If we have any further incidents in these areas, we are going to have to install cameras, take away keys, or take other measures to  stop them. I would really prefer that people just follow the rules, pay attention, and have concern and respect for their colleagues. </p>

<h3 id="toc_150">1. No smoking next to the building</h3>

<p>Even if it is cold or raining, there is no smoking next to our building. When people smoke near the shop garage door, it goes into our air intake and makes our rec room and offices around it smell like a casino. </p>

<h4 id="toc_151">2. Keep lobby doors locked on weekends and evenings</h4>

<p>Here is another one where I shouldn&rsquo;t have to be saying this again </p>

<h3 id="toc_152">3. Do not let anyone in you are not personally responsible for and watch for anyone coming in behind you.</h3>

<p>This means making sure the north door has closed. I  cannot stress this one enough and there will be disciplinary action up to and including termination for allowing this. </p>

<h2 id="toc_153">Das mailing W2s to your home address in workday. Make sure it is correct by Friday 1/21</h2>

<p>From Cheri: DAS will be mailing the W2s directly to employees to the address in WorkDay.  In the employees profile under Contact is the Home Contact Information.  If the Address in WorkDay is not correct it must be updated by this Friday, yes 1/21/2022!</p>

<h2 id="toc_154">Accessible Escape Room</h2>

<p>A big thanks to the Center Team for calling out my major memory lapse on the last escape room. Below is the excerpt from Coffee Talk with the actual stats. I apologize for getting that so wrong. I haven&rsquo;t heard of any teams wanting to go through on Monday or Tuesday. I need to know by 8:00 a.m. Monday if you have a team and when you would like.  </p>

<p>Excerpt from 8/9/19:<br>
It has been so much fun watching the friendly rivalry between the center and library folks over the escape room contest. The good natured trash talking and great team work and bonding both teams showed kept a big smile on my face all week. I’m a big believer in working hard and playing hard. It’s even better when we can have a good time while raising money for a good cause. The center team beat the room in 45 minutes and raised $60 for the Food Bank. While the library fell just short of beating the room, they did raise $117. Joe, Sharonda, Niah, and Sarah B. also beat the room just in the knick of time. </p>

<p>##IL Updates<br>
From Kim: IL Integration will be held in Des Moines for anyone 55 or younger Sunday, April 10 through Friday, April 15. OC and IL staff have scheduled their planning meeting for this upcoming training event. .<br><br>
 ##Center Corner<br>
From Karly:<br>
 Triangle Clangers:<br>
Kevin finished his baseball bat on Wednesday as well as graduating from the center.  We are very proud of him and look forward to his next chapter in BEP, which he is very excited about.<br>
Aaron started this past Friday and hit the ground running; his first day was our bowling activity and he is learning a lot and really enjoying training.</p>

<p>Everyone had fun and did a really great job last Friday traveling through the snow and bowling.</p>

<p>Reminders:<br>
RSVP&rsquo;s for tour day on January 28 are do tomorrow Friday 1/21 by end of day.<br>
Business class and center announcements will be in 2West from today through next Wednesday.</p>

<h2 id="toc_155">Wedding Celebration Invitation</h2>

<p>Randy Walford and Kim Barber invite IDB employees to our wedding reception celebration on Saturday, February 12 at Crown Point Community Center located at 6300 Pioneer Pkwy, Johnston, IA, 50131. The celebration is scheduled from 4 to 8 p.m. RSVP by texting 515-720-7919 with your name and how many will be in attendance. There will be cake, punch, and coffee plus we will have music provided by a local DJ service. – thank you.</p>

<h2 id="toc_156">Free COVID test website</h2>

<p>The website, <a href="https://www.covidtests.gov">COVIDTests.gov</a>, now includes a link for “every home in the U.S.” to access an order form run by the U.S. Postal Service. People can order four at-home tests per residential address, to be delivered by the Postal Service. </p>

<h2 id="toc_158">Accessible Escape  Room Fundraiser 1/23-1/24</h2>

<p>I am running a non-visual escape room for the LEAP retreat on 1/22. Traditionally, I will run the room for other groups who wish to put a team together as a fundraiser for the Food Bank.  The last time I was able to do this, the library put together a team that solved it. The center made a valiant effort but did not make it out in time. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun if you are into this kind of thing. It is a great team builder. Folks are required to wear sleep shades and you really do need a braille reader with you. (It&rsquo;s kinda the opposite of how it works usually.  for blind folks :) )  You have an hour to solve it. I&rsquo;d recommend a team of 4-8. It is $75 per team with all of that going to the food bank. I can run it 1/23 or 1/24 during lunch or at 4:30 work. Shoot me an email if you have a team that is interested and your preferred time. </p>

<h2 id="toc_159">director Update</h2>

<p>Things are starting to speed up after the slower pace of the holiday season. The big news is that the Governor included our appropriation requests, (both regular and capital) in her budget. We are extremely appreciative of the Governor&rsquo;s continued support for our agency and blind Iowans. For more info, data, and updates on the process, visit: <a href="https://blind.iowa.gov/ask23">https://blind.iowa.gov/ask23</a> </p>

<p>This month&rsquo;s Director&rsquo;s Forum is on Thursday 1/20 at noon rather than  Friday due to several scheduling conflicts. </p>

<p>We have been told to expect our VR program RSA monitoring report either today or next week. We then have 15 days to respond.</p>

<p>Karly wasn&rsquo;t able to send an update as they were out bowling. This was an activity planned by the students and I appreciate their rugged Iowa spirit in not letting winter stop them. Kevin did his business class and is scheduled to graduate on Wednesday. He wanted this day as it is his birthday, so you can tell him Happy Birthday and Congratulations both that day. </p>

<h2 id="toc_160">Wellness Tip of the Week</h2>

<p>The Five Ways to Wellbeing are – Connect, Be Active, Keep Learning, Give, and Take Notice.<br>
They help people take care of their mental health and wellbeing. Regularly practicing the Five Ways is beneficial for everyone – whether you have a mental health problem or not. Why the Five Ways work: Connect - Strengthening relationships with others and feeling close to and valued by others, including at work, is critical to boosting wellbeing. Be Active -Being physically active, including at work, improves physical health and can improve mood and wellbeing and decrease stress, depression and anxiety. Give - Carrying out acts of kindness, whether small or large, can increase happiness, life satisfaction and general sense of wellbeing. Take Notice - Paying more attention to the present moment, to thoughts and feelings and to the world around, boosts our wellbeing. Keep Learning - Being curious and seeking out new experiences at work and in life more generally positively stimulates the brain.</p>

<p>This is a very serious reminder to NOT let ANYONE into this building who is not with you. If you wish to be helpful, you can assist them in connecting with the person they are here to meet by calling that person, but they should not be allowed to enter and go find the person on their own. All IDB staff and those living in the building are responsible for the people they allow into this building and guests and service personnel always have someone assigned to know about their location and what they are doing. This is very important and anyone who lets someone into the building unaccompanied  is subject to disciplinary action or termination from their program. We take everyone&rsquo;s security very seriously here at IDB.</p>

<p>Important for Those Who Stay Overnight for Work</p>

<p>From Cheri: Beginning January 1, 2022, prior to expending or committing public funds for a purpose described below, a public employer or a public employee shall confirm a lodging provider’s current certification status on the internet site found at <a href="http://www.stophtiowa.org">www.stophtiowa.org</a>.<br>
Employees shall provide a screen shot of the search for the lodging provider showing it as a certified location with the request for reimbursement<br>
Go to the website <a href="http://www.stophtiowa.org">www.stophtiowa.org</a><br>
Navigate to the “Certified Locations” link, select this link. I recommend bookmarking this page if you will be traveling often.<br>
Navigate using headings to the “Certified Locations” Heading. You can also use the “Skip to main content” link at the top of the page to get to this heading.<br>
Tab once and you will be in the Certified Location search fields. There are 4 search fields: Location Name, County, Certified Date, and City. County and/or City will probably be the best options to find certified hotels. Location Name is for the actual name of the hotel, so it may not always be useful.<br>
When you find your hotel, print the webpage and save as a pdf. You will attach this to your Expense Report along with your receipts.<br>
Extra tip: Visually, there is a map in the middle of the screen with every certified location pinned on it. If you only use Tab, you will have to tab through every single location before getting to the search boxes.<br>
If your desired lodging is not on the list, the lodging can go to <a href="https://stophtiowa.org/training-library">https://stophtiowa.org/training-library</a> to take the training and get certified.<br>
December Weekend Retreat</p>

<p>From Jen: December 10th-12th, Students participated in an Olympic Themed Retreat. They worked hard using various types of Technology to research different countries. Participants were divided into groups to research the countries of Mexico, Italy, China, and Japan.  They researched their government, economy, geography, population, and some more intriguing facts such as what the deadliest animal was, popular music and sports, places tourists visit, and played the country’s national anthem for the group.<br><br>
In business class we learned about Paralympic athletes, what obstacles they had struggled against, how they overcame them, and what the definition of a “winner” was.  During the obstacle course, participants experienced physical obstacles and drew on our discussion to overcome their obstacles and have a winning attitude. <br>
Saturday we “LET THE GAMES begin!” Students showed some Mad Skills by competing in a variety of shaded Olympic inspired games. Darts proved to be No challenge for one of our very own YATP students. Annihilating the competition Emoni took her team the YULE LOGS to sweet victory. Ping Pong Basketball was a total Shut-Out by the COAL CHUCKERS, Olympic Ring Toss, well what can I say, no one stood a chance competing against the TWO FRONT TEETHERS, and they fought for all the glory in total domination. During a grueling game of Goal Ball, the HOLY NIGHTERS battled the TWO FRONT TEETHERS, while COAL CHUCKERS faced off with the YULE LOGS in the ultimate Battle Royale. Perhaps the closest game in IDB history. Knees were bruised, hands were sore, and spirits on high with the YULE LOGS once again brought home the victory with an 8-7 win.</p>

<p>Students enjoyed joining the NFB Christmas Party for lunch on Saturday. They stuffed their bellies and were able to meet some new people. We would like to THANK the CHAPTER for the invite.</p>

<p>Keeping up with the food, Students made a dessert from Mexico with the classic, Unfried Ice Cream. They also worked the cooking skills with homemade Brownies and Chocolate Chip Cookies. They were incredibly good and hit the spot after a long day of games and  physical activity.</p>

<p>Dinner was so graciously prepared by one of our coveted drivers Kim. Serving a family style meal, she took our students to Asia with Chicken Fried Rice, Pork Eggrolls, and Rangoon’s. Then headed south of the Border to Mexico with Beef Enchiladas, Pepper Meat, and Fiedo. It was all a big hit and students were for the most part open to trying some things they never had.</p>

<p>Closing out the weekend, Students showed off their grace and poise on the ice at Brenton Ice Rink. Though there was fear and nerves, all the students took a leap of trust in themselves to at least attempt to ice skate. A few of our students even surprised and challenged themselves to just let go of the rail. Students enjoyed listening to Christmas music while skating and warmed up with some hot chocolate. The Gold Medal however, must go to Quinn, for most Falls. <br>
Director’s Corner</p>

<p>I hope everyone has a happy new years. I am very excited for the year ahead. We have some continuing challenges ahead of us with the new variants of COVID, continuing concerns regarding differences in standards for the education and educational materials provided to blind students in Iowa, and the inclusion of blind people into Iowa Works centers and activities. However, we are continuing to fight the good fight, work hard to solve what we can solve, make better what we can make better, and empower blind Iowans to be gainfully employed and live independently. We have great staff and are working to get better. We have the support of the Governor’s office and legislature, and great committment to our colleagues and our mission and passion for what we do every day.<br>
One thing that you will hear me say sometimes that I picked up from folks who have been around here longer than me is the phrase “our IDB family.” For a while I was wondering if this phrase was too corny. But I was reflecting on this recently and decided it is actually perfect. You don’t pick your family. Sometimes your family members drive you bonkers. Sometimes they are your rock. Sometimes you can’t wait to see them and sometimes you can’t wait to get home. Sometimes you disagree about politics or who gets invited to cousin Tina’s wedding or who gets Grandma’s china, but we are all bound together by a common thread. For me our common thread at IDB is a belief in the normality of blind people and a certainty that with the proper training and opportunity, blind people can and do live full and happy lives and compete on terms of equality with our sighted peers. Remembering this helps me a lot when I’m frustrated or annoyed with something another member of our family did or didn’t do or said or didn’t say. Families, when they are working properly give each other grace and help each other grow. Speaking of threads, here is one of my favorite poems of all time: <br>
The Way It Is<br>
WILLIAM STAFFORD</p>

<p>There’s a thread you follow. It goes among<br>
things that change. But it doesn’t change.<br>
People wonder about what you are pursuing.<br>
You have to explain about the thread.<br>
But it is hard for others to see.<br>
While you hold it you can’t get lost.<br>
Tragedies happen; people get hurt<br>
or die; and you suffer and get old.<br>
Nothing you do can stop time’s unfolding.<br>
You don’t ever let go of the thread.<br>
I like to pick one word themes for the year to help me focus on what matters most. My theme for 2021 was “complete” to remind me to finish projects I start and also that I’m a complete and unbroken person no matter what anyone else might say. My theme for 2022 is going to be “Strengthen.” From a work standpoint this meanms we have been doing a lot of growing and modernizing and I want us to work on strengthen the programs we have rather than adding too much new. This will be reflected in the 2022 strategic plan for the Department of Management that is now being reviewed and discussed by the leadership team. <br>
(Also it is OK to be corny because we are the number one corn producing state in the country :). ) <br>

<p>Director Updates</p>

<p>I just wanted to take a minute to wish everyone p piece and joy during this holiday season. I know this can be a more stressful time of year for a lot of folks, and I hope folks are taking good care of themselves and maintaining a good work life balance. I know this is easier said than done. :-)</p>

<p>Looking back on 2021, it has been a good year and a challenging year. We had great things happen like the library being named library of the year, the average hourly wage at closure going up, in-person retreats, IL integrations and SELF weeks, and a ton of large and small success is for our clients. We have had to work through challenges such as new variants of COVID, ramp and elevator construction, and Workday. Thank you all for all your hard work and creativity to get us through the tough times and keep growing and expanding our programs and services. I really feel like we are building a culture of continuous improvement and I am very excited to see all that we and those we serve do in 2022.</p>

<p>As we are coming up on the new year, I’m working on my 22 for 22 list. This is a list of big and small things I would like to do this coming year. Here are my work related ones so far. I’m open to ideas and suggestions.</p>

<p>Sign a contract for a new case management system for VR and IL.<br>
Get in person, hands on, Crucial conversations training lined up for all staff based on the recommendation of the Client and Staff Safety Workgroup.<br>
Release Director’s Forum as a podcast and get out at least 4 episodes of “Work That Is Real” podcast<br>

<p>Wellness Tip of the Week: Express More Gratitude</p>

<p>When you come from a place of expressing gratitude both to what you have and the people around you, the change can be immense. <br>
If you express gratitude for what you have, you are less envious and fixated on what other people have. <br>
When you express gratitude to the important people in your life, it changes how you perceive them and how they feel about you. <br>
Gratitude increases your energy and your feelings of abundance. With gratitude, everything is appreciated. <br>
Gratitude also makes you a lot more creative and deepens your motivation. Handwritten notes, more expressive feelings, instantaneous notes or calls to the people that matter most become commonplace. <br>
The thing about gratitude, though, is that it requires an active pursuit in all areas of your business and life. It’s not about what that person has done for you. It’s about how you feel about them, and their value to you. <br>
Here’s a quick exercise: <br>
Think about the people that are most important to you. <br>
Next, write down 5 things you are grateful for, or appreciate, about that person. <br>
You could tell them the 5 things or just keep it to yourself and sense how you are with that person the next time you meet. <br>
Another important focus for gratitude is yourself. What are you grateful for today? <br>
Taking the time to look inwardly and appreciate what you have built momentum and motivation and makes you a lot happier.</p>

<p>I announced to the ECBV yesterday that we have made a structural change to BEP. The BEP program is being placed within the VR program. This has been discussed with Keri, Kathy, Matt, Roxy, and the Commission Board.This will create better synergies between BEP staff and VR Counselors, help with program recruiting, and expand self-employment resources for our clients. Matt, Roxy, and Kathy will all report to Keri on the org chart. Keri has been meeting with the team and the move is going well. I am confident this will improve BEP services and program performance. </p>

<h2 id="toc_181">Heads Up</h2>

<ul>
<li>As a rule, do Windows or Office updates regularly  unless you are specifically told by IT Staff not to do a particular update.</li>
<li>If you are completing a travel voucher, you must submit the original paper receipts for expense reimbursements to accounting.  These should be taped to a piece of paper and your name should be on the paper.  I know this seems like it shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary, but it is a DAS requirement and we can&rsquo;t change it. Please be kind to the accounting team and don&rsquo;t make them track these down.<br></li>
<li>As is our custom, December 20-30 will be jean days.</li>
<li>The Friends of the Library annual barber shop concert fund raiser will be held from  7:00-9:00 here at IDB in the assembly room. They usually have it at Java Joe&rsquo;s  but it is closed. Tickets are $10 at the door. The full flyer is below in the additional info section. </li>
<li>A big thanks to the Holiday Tea Committee and everyone who supported them. They were able to donate $500 to the Food Bank and $500 to Toys for Tots. That is going to do a lot of good for folks in need this holiday season!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_182">AR: Reporting COVID Testing To Your Supervisor and showing concern for your Colleagues, clients, and patrons</h2>

<p>If you dtes positive for COVID, you MIUST notify youyr supervisor. Here is a reminder of the DAS  requirements: and offer a framework for making </p>

<p>From DAS: COVID-19 Positive Case Confirmation<br>
State employees who test positive for COVID-19 must follow the following IDPH guidance regarding isolation and should contact their supervisor regarding leave status.<br>
Employees who test positive for COVID-19 should stay at home, away from other people, for 10 days after symptoms start and 24 hours with no fever and improved symptoms. If someone never developed symptoms, they should stay home for 10 days following a positive test.</p>

<p>If you are being tested for Covid, we ask that you notify your supervisor. We ask that you also keep your supervisor informed as to the results of the test even if the test is negative. </p>

<p>This is a happy and exciting time of year for many of us. There are a lot of gatherings and events that we all want to be healthy enough to attend. Please keep this in mind and think about the following when you are considering whether or not you should be coming to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I feeling too ill to do my job effectively?</li>
<li>could I be spreading illness to my colleagues, clients, or patrons?</li>
<li>If one of my colleagues came to work in the condition that I am in, would I be angry with them if Ai came down with the same illness?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is yes to any of these questions, you should stay home. We also do ask, we are not requiring, just asking, that folks consider wearing masks when in close contact with colleagues, clients, or patrons. I know everyone is sick of masks. I personally hate masks. I am so incredibly tired of wearing a mask, but I am going to continue to wear a mask in order to do all I can to keep myself, my love ones, my colleagues, and everyone else from getting any germs that might be going around  during this particularly germy season. There are several different viruses and infections going around in addition to Covid. No one wants to miss holiday celebrations because they are sick. Please help us all to stay happy and healthy through the coming months in any way you can. </p>

<h2 id="toc_183">AR: If  You Order From Amazon For Work</h2>

<p>From Cheri: IDB Accounting is implementing a streamlined billing process from Amazon.  Currently the agency has 2 payment methods with Amazon.  Please use the account ending in 3476 to order and pay for your Amazon purchases.</p>

<h2 id="toc_184">AR: Those Who Stay In Hotels for Work Must Be Aware</h2>

<p>From DAS: beginning January 1, 2022, State employees must confirm a lodging provider has received the Human Trafficking Prevention Training certification at <a href="https://stophtiowa.org/certified-locations">https://stophtiowa.org/certified-locations</a> prior to expending or committing public funds for in-state travel lodging, conferences, meetings, banquets, or any state-funded event. Employees who stay at non-certified facilities will not be reimbursed.</p>

<p>The quarterly Iowa Commission for the Blind meeting is Tuesday at noon. Here is the link:</p>

<p>While we are starting to have some events in the building and have been assured the ramp will be completed by the 10th, we are keeping the Commission Board meeting on Zoom this quarter. </p>

<p>I read a really interesting book recently called: &ldquo;Think Again&rdquo; by organizational psychologist Adam Grant; He demonstrates how re-thinking your assumptions, looking at issues like a scientist, embracing being wrong, changing your mind, and listening can make one&rsquo;s life better in all areas. I then found this video in an email that hits on some of the same points in a more compact way if you would like to learn more about having confident conversations. </p>

<h2 id="toc_201">Great Story</h2>

<p>Just received the below form recent center graduate Sara and thought all should hear. I think this could have been an IL teacher or a VR Tteacher, </p>

<p>I was taking a Lyft (to the department actually) and my Lyft driver related the following story and I thought I would share.</p>

<p>The driver said his wife drives with Paratransit and was picking up an older woman a while ago. Apparently, she was having a great deal of difficulty getting from her door to the car. Halfway to the car, she broke down crying. The paratransit driver got out of her vehicle and helped the woman to the car.</p>

<p>Fast forward one month later. This same woman, same driver. The woman was using her cane and had absolutely no trouble getting from her door to the car. Her confidence was palpable. The Paratransit driver was extremely impressed as the woman related her work with the Department.</p>

<p>I have no idea who the VRT is, or what training this woman has received. I only know there are three more people who have positive  experience/ exposure to IDB and that will continue to spread out to the general community.</p>

<p>Kudos,</p>

<p>We are encountering issues communicating with Freedom Scientific’s servers so you wont be notified that the updates are available. Because of this, we have placed the installer for JAWS 2022 along with the latest build of 2021 in an easy-to-access location. You will find it in the CommonGround folder under JAWS. As a reminder, the CommonGround folder is under h: then User. Simply select the file and activate it to start the upgrade. Answer “Run” when prompted about whether you are sure you want to run the application. Coming soon, you will also find instructions in this same folder for repairing JAWS if this should ever be necessary.</p>

<h2 id="toc_225">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Our quarterly volunteer newsletter was sent out today. A big thanks to Janice and Commissioner Ryan for all their hard work on this.   </p>

<p>Sarah W. and I met with Gov. Reynolds and her top staff yesterday morning. We had a great conversation regarding our desire to improve the statewide system for accessible materials production in our state. Sarah gave a really clear overview of the system, the issues, and how we can fix it. This is not something I wanted to have to bring up to the governor, but we have been trying for almost three years to work with the Iowa Department of Education to resolve serious quality, cost-effectiveness, and student privacy concerns that our staff have found and they are not responding. I also talked about our concerns with DAS and the accessibility oof training materials and forms for state employees and the issues with programatic accessibility  in Iowa Works centers. We shared with her about the exciting things we are doing in the library, the impact of our IL services on older Iowans losing vision, and bragged a bit about our $21.25 average hourly wage at closure for SFY21. The Governor was also pleased with that number. We invited her to the  Braille Challenge on February 26th. She was delighted to hear we were partnering with the Governor&rsquo;s STEM Council and putting on a a STEMfest.  The Governor also assured us that she is not going to combine IDB with any other agency and this is not on the table with the workforce realignment project that is underway. I&rsquo;m always struck when meeting with Gov. Reynolds at how much she remembers about our agency and what we have talked about years in the past. She really listens and her genuine care about our work has been proven by her fantastic support of our appropriation requests.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_239">If you hire drivers, use Ground Transportation for driver reimbursements In Your  Workday Expense Report</h2>

<p>From Cheri: After processing several Expense reimbursements it has been determined that going forward driver reimbursements need to be reported under the Ground Transportation Expense Item.</p>

<p>##Important Instructions for your laptop</p>

<p>From Wes: We have become aware of an issue with computers erasing the hard drive if the power button is held down for too long or if the computer improperly shuts down three times in a row. Improper shutdowns happen if the computer freezes and you hold the power button or if it freezes and then restarts back to encryption. The important points from the below steps are that you do not want to hold down the power button for too long and you want to properly shut down and turn on the computer after one of these events so that the error counter resets. Following these steps can save you downtime or even a trip into Des Moines to have the machine looked at. Please follow these steps </p>

<h3 id="toc_240">when the computer locks up or restarts:</h3>

<ul>
<li>If the computer freezes and you need to hold the power button in, the button should not be held any longer than thirteen seconds.</li>
<li>It’s a good bet that if your computer is locking up, there will be fan operation. If the fans are operational when you need to hold down the button, only hold button until fans cease, but no longer than thirteen seconds.</li>
<li>Power up the computer and put in the user ID and password for encryption. The computer will boot to the Windows Logon Screen</li>
<li>Now hit “OK” to get past our government property warning. You should now be on the screen where you enter your password; do not enter the password at this time.</li>
<li>Tab over to the button labeled “Power” and activate it, and choose “Shut Down” from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Power Up and log in normally.</li>
<li>Please do not wait to shut down the computer until you get fully logged on. Shutting down as outlined above gets the error counter reset sooner and limits the chances of lockups happening as the computer continues to boot.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_242">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Karly: The center is busy as usual.  On Monday, Sarah completed her 5.2 graduation walk.  We were so happy with the turnout for the triangle unveiling, thank you all for being a part of this awesome event! If you weren&rsquo;t able to be there, there is a video in the  pictures for outreach folder in Common Ground. The file is called&quot;triangle unveiling 21-10-19.&ldquo; We have tour day Today Friday, and students will have lunch with the client who is here today. </p>

<p>##Director Updates</p>

<p>Ramp progress is moving along nicely. I appreciate everyone working through the jack hammering. Hopefully the noice level will be lower as the project is completed and we have a great new ramp. </p>

<p>Fore those of you who weren&rsquo;t able to attend the surprise event on Tuesday:</p>

<p>During this event, we unveiled our new training center symbol. It hangs between the up and down stairs in the east lobby. A big thanks to the library folks for making our temporary signage. We will be getting more permanent plaques soon. The American Gothic will be moving to the hallway going toward the assembly room facing the north doors.Here is the text from the signs that hang below the triangle:</p>

<p>This triangle is  rung to celebrate important milestones achieved by students in in our adjustment-to-blindness training program.  It celebrates the important milestones that our students achieve!  These milestones include but are  not limited to: learning the braille code,<br>
Completing a drop off, finishing an industrial arts project,, serving a small or large meal, and earning  the Graduation. certificate.</p>

<p>The three sides of the triangle represent the three components of our comprehensive training: non-visual skills, self-confidence, and a positive attitude toward blindness. </p>

<p>We want to thank former Industrial Arts Instructor and Center Assistant Director, Dave Hauge, for creating this triangle and adding to his legacy of making a difference in the lives of countless blind Iowans. </p>

<p>When a student rings the triangle, we invite everyone in our IDB family  to share their congratulations and appreciate the student&rsquo;s hard work. </p>

<p>&quot;Remember to celebrate milestones as you prepare for the road ahead.&rdquo; &ndash; Nelson Mandela </p>

<p>We were very excited that the triangle&rsquo;s creator, Dave Hauge and our Commission Board Chair and Center graduate Sandi Ryan were able to be in attendance. The first person to ring the triangle was Dr. Sara Coleman. She had just completed her 5.2 mile graduation walk the day before. Center Director Karly Prinds spoke and Nami Wallace was thanked for her assistance in getting this project completed and keeping it under wraps until the unveiling. </p>

<p>A big thanks also goes to Sarah Willeford and Randy Wallford for their help in picking the location and getting the holder mounted. We are very excited to embark on this new tradition. One particular feature of the triangle is that at the top of the triangle is a heart. The Center is the heart of our agency and love for our students and belief in the ability  to live their dreams is at the core of everything the Center does. </p>

<h2 id="toc_250">Director Updates</h2>

<p>On Wednesday, Cassie Halls, the Workforce Realignment consultant hired by the Governor&rsquo;s office  visited us at IDB. She was very interested in learning about the many and varied programs and services that we offer. She enjoyed  learning about VR, BEP, IL, the Center, our field training, and our library. She was not aware of all that IDB does to serve blind Iowans and the vast history of our agency and the blindness community in Iowa.  </p>

<p>A number of folks have probably already heard about some organizational changes we will be undertaking in the coming months. While I love the center and believe it to be the heart of our agency, the numbers of students that we have had in recent months made dedicating an entire FTE to jobs and life class inefficient. This is particularly true when we look at the needs that we have for other positions across  our VR programs. During our RSA review, we became particularly  aware that we need to put significant effort into improving the quality of services we are currently receiving from community rehabilitation providers (CRPs)as well as devote more resources to monitoring our contracts with these CRPs. We need to ensure that the taxpayers and our clients get a good return on the investments we are making in these services. To this end, the center jobs instructor position is being eliminated in order to use this position   to meet the needs outlined above. More details about these changes will be shared once we receive our monitoring report and we ensure that our   re-allocation of resources is  in full  alignment with RSA&rsquo;s concerns. We will be eliminating the jobs/life skills position at the end of the calendar year and posting the new VR position at that time. While it is never our first choice to eliminate a position, we are using this as an opportunity to improve the career readiness   of  center students. The Center is partnering with Keri&rsquo;s team to dedicate a  VR counselor to working with center students on all aspects of career readiness including work experiences, volunteering and enrolling in  post-secondary education. This is a part of the Center&rsquo;s rededication to and realignment toward career readiness throughout the program. The new schedule allows more time for tech and braille as these skills are key to employment success. Bringing the practical and soft skills covered by the life skills class back into home management will allow for more integration of techniques. Small and large meals aren&rsquo;t really that much about cooking, they are about time management, organization, and all of the soft skills related to hosting. Industrial Arts can teach someone the skills to be a carpenter or cabinet maker, but it&rsquo;s more about problem solving and confidence building. Karly and her team are dedicated to ensuring that no one finishes the center and goes home and sits. They know there are folks in our agency who don&rsquo;t have total faith in this and the Center Team are determined to change their minds. I&rsquo;m really excited to see the growth in expectations and energy in the Center in the coming year.     </p>

<h2 id="toc_251">Job Openings</h2>

<p>We are still working to get postings through the workday system and hope to have the Sec 1 for VR open soon. </p>

<p>We have started our TSA training back up in the center and went last Friday.  Everyone learned a lot and we are excited to continue these trainings in the future!  We are also going to have a new schedule for the center starting on October 18th.  Business class will be moved from 4:10 to 11:30 each day and bee 60 minutes rather than 50 minutes.  This should make it easier for other staff throughout the agency to attend!</p>

<h2 id="toc_260">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Due to diminished attendance, the Communications Team is ending the all agency chats. With the change in business class timing, staff will be able to meet their continuing education requirements at any time during  the year by attending business classes that fit their schedule. The Communications Team is working on other ways forr folks to come together and get to know one another,  improve our internal relationships, and ability to communicate with one another, so stay tuned for more information :)</p>

<p>The Library hosted about 30 librarians from across the state for the Iowa Library Association Pre-Conference on Wednesday. Once again big thanks to the library folks an maintenance for making the first floor look so great.  </p>

<p>We are really excited to be hosting SELF Week next week. We have 10 participants from acrosss the state. I&rsquo;m really excited by the increasing collaboration between ETT and the Center on these events. </p>

<p>The BEP hosted a strategic planning session on Thursday and the annual statewide meeting on Friday.  Our national BEP advisor, Terry Smith, came to facilitate the strategic planning and address the group on Friday morning. Terry shared that the need to innovate and get creative is a national challenge and warned that if the program does not find new ways to grow, it will die out. Matt gave a stirring  presentation on the importance of taking pride in your operation and in the program and Kathy took questions and conducted a listening session. Amena shared technology that would help vendors be more efficient in their work. Scott Marchant and Darryl Rockford were elected to the Elected Committee of Blind Vendors (ECBV). The afternoon will feature more training . Kathy, Matt, Roxy, and Dorothy worked very hard to put together what I believe to be a very successful annual meeting.  </p>

<p>From Helen: Thanks to Veronica, Ross, Kait and everyone else involved for a successful first Youth Weekend Retreat of the year.<br>
It was a successful initial weekend retreat after a long hiatus, and we had eight wonderful students attend. Friday night students participated in improv games and an group activity to venture through the library stacks from third floor to the basement. The next day, students constructed ping pong ball catapults and competed against each other to obtain the highest score based on distances. For this challenge, Nathan Deeds won by a landslide. The students had an opportunity to prepare their meals for the weekend, before we ventured out into the community for our main event. The group challenged themselves at Urban Air Ankeny, an indoor obstacle course park, where everyone completed the warriors course, which is an obstacle course surrounded by a giant ball pit. Some of the students traversed the ropes course challenge using nerves of steel and their canes to navigate ten feet above the floor and other people. Each length in the ropes course was typically constructed of small, spread out platforms of varying sizes with only occasional ropes for gripping. One particular group of brave souls conquered a path in the ropes course with tilting x-shaped platforms, where they needed to have both feet to keep the platform level. After this excitement, students had the chance to relax, socialize, and play either card or yard games in the assembly room. Sunday morning we had a business class about challenging yourself and getting out of your comfort zone, and we finished with a team-building exercise.<br>
Our next retreat is October 30. Attached is the flyer with the registration link.</p>

<p>I know the Woray roll out has been very confusing and frustrating. I appreciate everyone&rsquo;s patience. I also really appreciate all the work everyone in accounting and all the support staff have put in making things work and helping folks out when it doesn&rsquo;t. Please let&rsquo;s all treat one another with kindness and give some extra smiles to the accounting and secretarial folks when. Also a ton of extra work was dumped on our personnel assistant at DAS, so things lik background checks and other personnel things are just taking longer right now. We are sorry about this and wish we could do something about it, but it&rsquo;s just out of our hands. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  excited to speak to NFBI on Saturday morning at 9:30. Sarah W. will be talking about the library at 10:00. I&rsquo;ve heard that NFBI is looking to recognize the great work of our library and their receipt of the Library of the Year Award. :)</p>

<h2 id="toc_278">Shout Out</h2>

<p>The below is an excerpt from an IL client  after IL Integration. I thought it was best presented as a shout out to all those named and not named who made this week a success</p>

<p>Just wanted to say thanks again Connie for all of your efforts and looking out for me while I was in Des Moines.  You have become a very good teacher.</p>

<p>Cayla had told me that if I wanted to learn more braille that I should contact you for further resources to learn braille.  So I am letting you know that I am interested in doing so. </p>

<p>I learned a lot at IL, but as we discussed that knowledge has to be utilized and grown in my everyday living.  I have already made a strong effort to do that. <br>
Please share the following with: <br>
           Enrique – I have entered 14 thirty minute appointments on my calendar to practice and learn my phone better<br>
           Darren – When Gail opened my suitcase to find clothes for the laundry she discovered my picture frame.  She said “John this is gorgeous, holy s***! Honey this is really beautiful.”  Darren, thanks for making me look good.<br>
           Zach – I have already taken two solo five block trips back home.  My first solos.  It was easier than I thought.  Thanks for the confidence Zach!<br>
           Cayla – Since you found me in the wilderness and put me on the right path, I have decided to learn more braille and have let my teacher know I want to follow up and learn more.<br>
           Nami – Saturday morning I fixed breakfast for Gail, an omelet with mushrooms, onions, and ham…plus toast and coffee.  Thanks for encouraging me to start cooking again. </p>

<p>Connie, I would like to treat the group to a good pizza party or something similar.  How would I go about doing that?  Can I send you money to do that? </p>

<p>I very much appreciate you encouraging me to take this big step and spend a week in independent living training.  It was an excellent, albeit a challenging, experience with many benefits.</p>

<h2 id="toc_279">Another Shout Out</h2>

<p>Congratulations Jeremiah! we received notification of our first Social Security reimbursement payment this week. Becoming able to process these requests is a long process and we are very glad Jeremiah has been able to complete this and we appreciate his hard work!</p>

<p>The Library is running low on Perkins Braillers that we loan to patrons and clients.  If you happen to have one that you are no longer needing, we would love to have it.  Please drop them off with Jerry (his office is on the north side of 4th floor).  Thank you! </p>

<h2 id="toc_282">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Karly: The center is full of energy which is so exciting! The students have started a braille study group in the evenings, Sarah completed a drop off this week and Kevin has a small meal today. We are excited to go apple picking on Tuesday!</p>

<h2 id="toc_283">Director Updates</h2>

<p>The Iowa Commission for the Blind met on Tuesday. They approved our budget request. Cheri is working hard getting it into the system. I am putting together requested information for the Governor&rsquo;s office. For those not familiar with the process, typically in October or November, the Governor meets with department heads and gathers information. She then put together her proposed budget by early January. This is sent to the legislature. We are sometimes (about every other year) asked to present to the legislature in January or February. Our budget is included in the education appropriation bill. Typically this comes out in late March, April, or May. Once the bill is passed by both the House and Senate, it goes to the Governor for signature. Then we know how much money we have for the coming fiscal year that starts July 1. So the budget that was approved on Tuesday is what we are asking for for State Fiscal Year 23 starting July 1, 2022. In addition to our general fund request that funds all our programs, we ask for a capital request to make repairs to our building. In December, we will be putting in a new small boiler as this was approved in our SFY22 (current year) request. Next year we have asked for money for more  roof and tuck pointing repairs. </p>

<p>The ramp construction is scheduled to begin on October 11th. They have the end date listed as 11/24. The company awarded the project is the same that did much of our 2008 renovations, so that was comforting to learn that they do know a bit about us and were good to work with in the past.  Fingers crossed and knock on wood it will all go smoothly and on time from here on out.</p>

<p>We will have a number of librarians attending our Iowa Library Association pre-conference event on October 6th. We are excited to have them her eto learn about how they can make their libraries more welcoming and connect their patrons to our services. </p>

<p>I shared the below poem with the leadership team and they suggested that I put it in Coffee Talk. It&rsquo;s one of my all time favorites. I used to emboss it and have my students read it on Literary Thursdays when I taught braille. I feel like it says a lot about the kind of people who work here and the kind of work ethic we want to promote in our clients so they can be successful and thrive  in their employment.</p>

<h3 id="toc_284">To Be Of Use</h3>

<p>BY MARGE PIERCY</p>

<p>The people I love the best<br>
jump into work head first<br>
without dallying in the shallows<br>
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.<br>
They seem to become natives of that element,<br>
the black sleek heads of seals<br>
bouncing like half-submerged balls.</p>

<p>I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,<br>
who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,<br>
who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,<br>
who do what has to be done, again and again.</p>

<p>I want to be with people who submerge<br>
in the task, who go into the fields to harvest<br>
and work in a row and pass the bags along,<br>
who are not parlor generals and field deserters<br>
but move in a common rhythm<br>
when the food must come in or the fire be put out.</p>

<p>The work of the world is common as mud.<br>
Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.<br>
But the thing worth doing well done<br>
has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.<br>
Greek amphoras for wine or oil,<br>
Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums<br>
but you know they were made to be used.<br>
The pitcher cries for water to carry<br>
and a person for work that is real.</p>

<p>From Karly: This week the OC has been busy with IL Integration.  The positive energy was contagious and there were some great connections made along the way!  The Home Management job posting is live now and will be up for two weeks.</p>

<p>## Director Updates<br>
   The Commission Board meeting is at noon on Tuesday. Connection info is below. The packet is on our website. </p>

<p>I want to give a big thanks to Janice and all the accounting folks for all their work on making Workday work. I know this has been a hugely frustrating process. Please everyone do show them a little extra  understanding and patience. Also, if there is a glitch in Workday, please don&rsquo;t freak out. Everyone will get their approved vacation and everyone will get paid. Change is challenging for us all and while there is a learning curve, eventually this will be faster and easier on everyone. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a bit of an uptick in the number of agitated or frustrated people that we all encounter in our work life. I&rsquo;m guessing a lot of us are seeing this outside of work as well. When a client or patron or colleague is upset and and decides to direct their anger at you, it&rsquo;s hard to keep from taking it personally, even when you know it doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with you. Not to go into a wellness lecture :) but I do hope we all take a moment to breathe and find ways to refill our inner wells of compassion &ndash; both for others and for ourselves. Sometimes are jobs get pretty   difficult and it is hard to find the joy and meaning. Refilling that compassion well helps me to recognize and enjoy the great things, like client successes and finished projects. Karly has started a cool new feature in center morning announcements. She has folks share their small victories. It might be a client sharing about a hard travel route or a computer problem they solved or a way they helped someone in the public better understand blindness. It might be a staff person sharing some of the same things or other things like how they did a home repair or created a new habit. I have found it really uplifting and idea I  worth sharing. If you have other tips for uplift and boosting positivity around the agency, please let me know as I&rsquo;d love to share them.</p>

<p>Sorry for being late and brief his week. It’s budget and Board meeting prep season. The packet will be coming out shortly and I encourage everyone to read it and ask questions. A couple of center announcements since Karly is very busy: We had a new student, Fransisco, start last Tuesday. Please make him feel welcome if you see him around. The posting for the Home Management Instructor should be going live very soon. Also, I know Helen is wanting to get out an announcement, but she is also very swamped today. We are excited to welcome Vanasha Washington as a new Youth Services Worker with YATP. She will be doing a modified staff training as she has graduated from a structured discovery program at BLIND, Inc. </p>

* We all need to complete the required training. If you haven&rsquo;t already done it, you should be receiving reminders. Follow the directions in the reminder emails. If you are a screen reader user and have not received training tenet connection information, please contact your supervisor. This must be completed by 9/13.<br>
* The last time we will use the current time tracking system is the pay period ending 9/16.</p>

<ul>
<li>During the pay period of 9/17-9/30, you need to set aside some time to familiarize yourself with the Workday system, work through the smart guides, practice, and ask questions of your supervisor. If you sit down at your computer on the morning of Wednesday, September 29th and are opening Workday for the first time, this will be super frustrating for you and your supervisor. You need to become familiar and get your questions answered BEFORE this time.</li>

<h2 id="toc_313">Update to Obituary From Last Week</h2>

<p>Dorothy had a great memory to share of Joel Lightcap:</p>

<p>I was greatly saddened to read of the passing of Joel Lightcap in Coffee Talk.  I knew Joel as we attended the Orientation Center together in the late 1980s.  I do have a funny memory of him you can pass along to whoever may be interested. </p>

<p>Joel was always telling me he was going to make me a pair of burlap underwear, to which I responded burlap would be a very itchy material and there’d be no way to scratch the itch.  I always took this as a joke, which I thought it was.  However, the day I, along with six other people, graduated, Jim Witte, Orientation Director at that time, said, “We don’t usually give gifts when people graduate the Center, but today we have an exception,” which of course excited everybody’s curiosity.  Joel had actually gone into the sewing room and made me a pair of burlap underwear and went down to the shop and made me a board with nails in it as a scratcher! </p>

<p>Thought this would give people a laugh in their time of grief, so please feel free to pass this on. </p>

There are pictures at the bottom of the email of Dorthy’s project and also Lori Jones from Easter Seals with her picture frame.</p>

<p>Center Tour Days</p>

<p>The Center Team is excited to announce we will be holding monthly tour days. The next one will be Thursday, September 23rd starting at 11:00 a.m. Generally tour days will be on the 4th Wednesday of each month going forward, but in September, the students are volunteering to do tree clearing at Living History Farms earlier that week so the date needed to be adjusted. . Lunch will be prepared and served by the center students. The counselor and/or teacher working with the student is welcome to join us for the lunch. We would ask that folks let Karly know who will be attending by noon on the Friday before the tour day so that we can get a good count for the food. Thanks!</p>

<p>the Anxious Achiever and this particular episode as being relevant to a number of folks in our agency. It talks about the anxiety that comes from being the only or the first in a given work situation. I think it&rsquo;s not only relevant to many of us, but I think it does shed some insight into the fears our clients often have about going back to work when they are going to be the only blind person in the place they will be working. One could argue it is one of the reasons that folks will want to stay working in a sheltered shop rather than seeking employment in the community. I would ask folks to listen ahead of time as it is about a half an hour long. Here is the link and   connection info to the Zoom.</p>

<h2 id="toc_333">Workday Time Sheet Transition Cheat Sheet</h2>

<p>I know folks have gotten some confusing emails on this, but here is a start to a cheat sheet for what you need to know and we will update this as more info is available:</p>

<h3 id="toc_334">For Everyone</h3>

<ul>
<li>The switch will happen on 9/17. This is probably going to mean that time sheets that would be due on 9/15 will need to be in a little sooner, but there will be more details to come on how things will work that week. </li>
<li>In the new system, all of your leave slips must be completed and approved before you can do your time sheet.</li>
<li>Screen reader and screen magnification users will need access to the testing site to do the training that was sent out earlier in the week. We are working on getting this set up, however, the training itself is accessible. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_335">For Support staff who review time sheets</h3>

<ul>
<li>You will be set up as a time keeper. You need to make sure to only review and NOT approve the time sheets. The manager needs to do the approval. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_336">Alerts  and Severe Weather</h2>

<p>Wes asked me to share the 2 attached articles. He writes: </p>

<p>The first is about the test of the Emergency Alert System. People may hear alerts if they are near a radio or TV station. Our phones, if none of the Government Alert Settings under Notifications were changed, should receive the wireless emergency alert test. Both of these will happen Wednesday at 1 PM Central. I don’t know what this will do with Alert Iowa. The backup date is 8/25/21.</p>

<p>The second article is about better emergency alerts for severe thunderstorms and answers the question of why our phones didn’t do anything during the Derecho last year.</p>

<h2 id="toc_337">Mask Questions</h2>

<p>With the new CDC guidance,there have been questions as to whether our mask requirements have changed. They have not and won&rsquo;t unless we are given new guidance by the Governor&rsquo;s office or DAS. As always, people should feel comfortable wearing masks if they choose and  It is very considerate to wear a mask if you have been near anyone with any contagious  illness such as a cold or you yourself might think you have any  contageous illness. It would be really great if we as a larger society could going forward view mask wearing as a kindness to our communities and loved ones, but let&rsquo;s definitely make this the culture at IDB.  </p>

<p>From Kait: This past Friday LEAP students went on a canoe trip in Monticello, IA. Students worked on navigating  the Maquoketa River by listening to sound cues, and cardinal directions. Students did a wonderful job communicating with their canoe partners to row their canoe.  Students also enjoyed swimming in the river, racing some of the canoes, and  singing quite a few pirate songs and  making lots of jokes. The students are excited for the upcoming camping trip this weekend.</p>

<p>From Helen: I am sad to share that Ashley Kirvin will be leaving us August 19 in order to focus on graduate school. Her involvement in getting YATP up and running this year, both in terms of her solid work with students and her creation of items like our student Code of Conduct have been much appreciated. We wish her well going forward.</p>

<h2 id="toc_344">Center Updates</h2>

<p>\From Al: Soo Keea completed her 5.2 grad walk and graduated on Wednesday.  She took this opportunity to talk about herself a little, which had never happened her whole time through training.  She talked about where she came from and what impact that had on her life.  I am so happy that she has put forth the effort that she has, and I am proud of the accomplishments she has made.  On Friday Sara completed her final meal, which ended in a dessert of a chocolate tort cookie.  The rest was great, but it ended in a chocolate tort cookie, so…<br>
Don’t forget that next Friday is tour day at the center.  We will be preparing lunch for people coming through for tours.  Please just let me know by Wednesday how many people you will have.</p>

DO NOT choose the option “Pay By Invoice” which is confusingly listed under “IDB line of credit”.  We are working on removing the Pay By Invoice option altogether, so to reiterate, please use the Amazon Business Line of Credit ending in 3476 for any Amazon orders.

<p>Last week I turned in our agency&rsquo;s required Affirmative Action Report and Plan. Our goals for this year will be to try to figure out where we currently stand, gather input and feedback from all staff on how we can do better and create initiatives from that feedback. The problem for us with the state&rsquo;s system is that they do not track any data on non-merit hires. This constitutes the majority of our hiring, so we don&rsquo;t have a good sense, other than anecdotally, where we stand currently in terms of our diversity of race, gender, LGBTQ, or disability. We value diversity and we have seen how much more innovative it has made us. I&rsquo;m not unhappy with where we are at, but I know we can always do better and we can be more welcoming and supportive of everyone. I am very happy with the effort everyone has been putting into  the 200% Accountability Project and intend to carry that into the next year. One area I&rsquo;ve noticed recently that I would like us to be better at is being more welcoming and supportive to people experiencing mental health issues. We talk a lot about EAP (Employee Assistance Program) and the great services that Kepro provides as part of that program, but it is important that   depression, anxiety, or any other mental health issue can be given as much or as little openness as a broken leg or diabetes. People can choose to keep it to themselves or share as they feel comfortable. A therapy session is just like any other   medical appointment. While there is no need to share, there should also be no fear of stigma. I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve done a great job role modeling this and I&rsquo;d like to change that. I share my story at New Staff Seminar, but I have sometimes told it like it is all past tense. I continue to have episodes of depression. I mostly can hide them and thought I needed to do so, especially after I became director, because there were some folks out there who like to really tear into IDB Directors and I was afraid to give them ammunition. Also, it is a pretty common belief that staff lose faith in leaders who aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;strong.&rdquo; So I&rsquo;m going to take the chance that you all won&rsquo;t think less of me. I think it is a chance worth taking  because I don&rsquo;t want anyone in this agency to feel that they need to hide any mental health challenge they might be facing. I&rsquo;d like to hear what suggestions folks have for ways that we can as an agency do better in this area and across the board. As part of the plan, we will be putting out an anonymous survey or two, but feel free to share with  me or  your supervisor  any suggestions  directly if you feel comfortable doing so or you can use the anonymous question  form at: </p>

<h2 id="toc_352">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Emily: I need to share how incredibly impressed I was with Cheri, Helen, and Keri throughout the RSA monitoring process. I&rsquo;ll describe the process more below, but I wanted to say that I knew already that each of these folks was smart, talented, and dedicated before this process began, but I was absolutely blown away with their knowledge of their areas of expertise, team work, and patience with being asked the same questions over and over again. I also have to give a huge thanks to Janice. I can&rsquo;t imagine how we would have gotten everything compiled and kept track of all their«RSAs additional requests without her. I think there is an art to being an executive secretary and Janice really demonstrated this over the past two months. I could not be prouder to work with such amazing colleagues!</p>

<p>Also, I was sent a thank you note by a parent that talked about how great Ashley, Kait, and Luis (a.k.a. Coach a.k.a. Snackmaster)  had been working with a  student. It was clear from the email that these folks are really bringing the skill and the love! </p>

<h2 id="toc_353">AR: For those who travel</h2>

<p>From Cheri: Good news! That state rate for in state hotel has had an approved increase to $80 per night plus applicable tax. </p>

<p>Please get all your state fiscal year 2021 paperwork, invoices, approvals and travel completed.  The holding period is almost over.</p>

<h2 id="toc_354">Director&rsquo;s Updates</h2>

<p>The Microsoft Teams portion of the RSA monitoring completed on Friday. Even RSA described the two weeks as &ldquo;grueling.&rdquo; It was a seemingly endless stream of requests for documentation and hours of trying to explain what we do and how we do it. We will continue to answer questions via email in the coming weeks and we were told to expect a draft report in mid-September.  We we will have at least one finding. They want us to track something that our accounting system won&rsquo;t track that we are very unlikely of doing incorrectly due to how we do our federal draw downs. However, when we discovered their interpretation, Cheri and her awesome accounting team figured out a procedure to track the item RSA said they wanted tracked. We submitted this to RSA and asked if it would correct the problem. They said they would not look at it until after the report and finding were issued. It was this kind of thing that made this whole experience very disheartening to me. I know that policy and procedure are important and we do need to do better in documenting our processes and getting folks credit for the great work they are doing through improvements in case documentation, but I never want to become the kind of director that cares more about policy than people . I told RSA flat out that if it comes down to a choice between providing service and tracking down documentation, we will always choose service. So to me, the most valuable take away from this experience is that I need to become vigilant against becoming a bureaucrat and never forget our mission of empowering blind Iowans to be gainfully employed and live independently. I&rsquo;m excited to get back to meaningful work  like leading LEAP business class, supporting our library&rsquo;s acquisition of a vendor portal, and working on obtaining an update to eForce. </p>

<li><p>BEP Counselors are helping vendors learn to use the data that comes with credit card readers to save on merchandise costs and travel, and to help identify best and slow sellers to create the most profitable product mix. This means some vendors are learning to use the computer to be able to do this. The team is also looking at profitability with an aim to share opportunities to hone budgets for more profit.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_386">Director Updates</h2>

<p>We got final confirmation today on COLA and in grade increases for this year. I wanted to be able to do more for in grade increases this year, however, DAS has capped merit based increases at 3%.  Here is the scheme we will be using this year. </p>

<h5 id="toc_387">Points Key:</h5>

<p>Each evaluation has 3 goals. For the rating given to each of these three goals, the following points are given. The overall rating does not effect the points total. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does Not Meets =  -2 points</li>
<li>Meets =1 point</li>
<li>Exceeds = 2 points</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_388">SFY22 Point Values</h3>

<ul>
<li>2points = 1%</li>
<li>3 points = 1.5%</li>
<li>4 points = 2%</li>
<li>5 points = 2.5%</li>
<li>6 points = 3%</li>
</ul>

<p>So someone earning 3 exceeds would receive a 3% in grade increase. Someone earning 3 meets would receive  a 1.5% increase. Someone with 2 exceeds and a does not meets would get a 1% increase, etc.</p>

<p>If you have questions, please reach out to me or your supervisor. It is kinda easy to get behind on writing and signing evaluations and IPPEs in a year where we have no in grade increase available, but it is really important that we get any overdue IPPE or evals turned in by June 30th to ensure eligibility for merit based increases next year.</p>

<p>I was really excited to share about all the exciting things we had going on during my monthly Director&rsquo;s Forum today. When I sat down to make my list, I was smiling at how full it was and how exciting the items were to share. </p>

<li>In the search box, type the word “Update” then navigate the list of results to Check for Updates and activate it.
•   Your focus is placed back in the search box. This is a standard dialog so screen reader users can navigate with tab and arrows.</li>
<li>Navigate past the search box and the list of updates. There will either be an “Install Now” or a “Download and Install” button. Activate this.
You may need to activate the “Check for Updates” button.
If neither of these options is available, Windows is still checking for updates. The list of updates or the Check for Updates button will reappear after the update check finishes.</li>
<li>Windows will install updates. You can close this dialog and use your computer normally.</li>
<li>Eventually, you will be prompted to restart. You can restart immediately, or, choose “Update and Shutdown or Update and Restart next time you are ready to do one of those two actions.Note that if “Update and Shutdown is chosen, the boot time on the next start of your computer will be much longer as the updates are installed.
6 after the computer restarts, Windows will load and you will see messages explaining that the computer is working on updates and not to power it off; percentages are often given in these messages. Note that it is common for the computer to sit at 100% for a bit before being ready to use as it tidy’s up after the install. If not sure, just hit “Escape to get to the password screen; if it&rsquo;s not ready, it won’t do anything.</li>

<p>As it is almost new state fiscal year, half of the Communications Team membership will turn over in July. I want to give a big thanks to Karly, Tim, and Drew who  provided great ideas and lead great All Agency Chats. Karly also did an awesome job as chair keeping things moving forward. While we will miss these folks, Leslie, Kayla, and Hannah N. will be great additions to the team. Since Kelsi was vice-chair last year, she will move up to chair for the next year.  Here is the new list of the Comm Team members:</p>

</ul>

<p>Because rotating the leadership of the Communications Team has opened up opportunities for developing leadership skills to more people, I, with the help of the leadership team,  have developed the below revision to the employee committee procedures. We believe this will give more opportunities for more people to learn how to run meetings, organize projects, and other important skills that benefit all of us in our work.<br><br>
This will go into effect on July 1 and does mean that those who have been leading employee committees for more than one year will need to step aside to allow someone new to have this opportunity. I really appreciate all the great things these folks have done to help our community and  make IDB a better place and hope they will continue to participate and assist the new leaders.  </p>

<p>Employee Committees &amp; Teams Procedures</p>

<p>In order to create a positive and productive work environment, IDB has allowed for the creation of employee committees. These committees include: the Food Bank Committee, the Employee Recognition Committee (ERC), and the Holiday Tea Committee</p>

<p>These committees will hold elections in July of each year to elect the committee chair or co-chairs of that committee. Each committee member as of June 30th will be allowed to vote in this election. Committee chairs may serve no more than 2 consecutive years as chair of the committee. (Those in the role of chair when this revision goes into effect on 7/1/21 who have served two consecutive years in the role will need to step down)</p>

<p>You may have also noted that the Toys for Tots Committee is being dissolved. Holiday Tea has taken on this fundraising in the past couple of years and it was becoming harder to coordinate toy drop off locations. We do appreciate the work these folks put in going back to the days of Roger Erpulding and we will continue to support this worthy cause in other ways.  </p>

<p>##Successes, Struggles, and Suggestions Project Update<br>
 From the Communications Team:<br><br>
The Communications Team has been exploring ways for each of us to learn more about what we do at the IDB and to support one another.  We all have challenges with our positions, but also all share the same goal….serve Iowa’s Blind.<br>
     A fun and informative activity that we’ve done with our Communications Team is exploring the 3S’s…Successes, Struggles and Suggestions.  Here we discussed topics around, but not limited to 3 S’s (Successes, Struggles, Suggestions).  We paired up with someone from outside of our division (within the Communications Team) and discussed/shared one of the 3 S’s.  It can be based on  personal life, interactions with co-workers or interactions with clients. You can make a video , audio recording,or simply a written statements/blurb.  We are encouraging people to pair up with someone outside of their division. We found this to be a  great way to learn more about what each of us does at the IDB.<br>
        This activity is voluntary.  As mentioned, the Communications Team has already done some videos and audio recordings  and those can be found in a folder on the CommonGround folder on the H drive , next to Staff Individual Videos.  Please consider participating in this team building activity.  Think outside of the box, be creative and have fun.  There’s no right or wrong way to do this.  The end goal is to help others, make others feel good about the work we do and get to know each other better.  More information to come. </p>

<p>From Kathy: Please welcome Kathy Bowman who is an AARP volunteer working with BEP to digitize BEP records! Her space is directly across from the 3rd floor copy machine. You’ll find her there 8:30-12:30 Monday-Friday and she loves meeting people. Since her work involves a lot of paperwork, an occasional hello would be welcome!</p>

<p>BEP Business Counselors have been traversing Iowa getting to know vendors, are helping vendors transform two locations into micro markets this summer, and are teaching telemetry (how to see what your machines are doing and selling remotely) to eager learners. Sam Claassen has decided to leave his BEP facility and will leave BEP for other ventures, effective Tuesday, June 8. At the Elected Committee of Blind Vendors meeting last week, the vendors who have been collaborating with Matt and Roxy on developing a robust outline for training of new vendors expressed happiness that great strides have been made to build on the improvements Al Bickell had made in the training.</p>

<p>Unless something is actually and literally flooded or burning, please do not contact Dave or Randy after 10:00 on Wednesdays. They are dedicating this time to completing the youth library space so that it is ready for in person programming in September. Also it is really important that everyone use the maintenance request form for all non-emergency issues. You can find this form at: <a href="https://iowadeptblind.wufoo.com/forms/z190vrq01nn2xiz/">https://iowadeptblind.wufoo.com/forms/z190vrq01nn2xiz/</a>.

<h2 id="toc_406">From the Center</h2>

<p>From Al: Lori completed her meal which consisted of a seven layer salad, ham balls, risotto, and apple crisp for dessert. Caprice started the center, and the students visited the dart central station, and the sculpture park to point out the problem braille that is present at these locations. As they were showing the people what was wrong with the braille, dots were falling off just to prove their point.##Director Updates</p>

<p>Because of the Board-meeting on Tuesday, we will not be having the 2nd Tuesday All Agency Chat on June 8th. This Board meeting i being held on Zoom but we are hopeful that the September meeting will be held in person with a Zoom-option for those who cannot be here in person. It looks like we are on track to have All Staff and New Staff Seminars in August in person. There were folks asking about the roof being available for fireworks this year. Unfortunately, there will not be fireworks in Des Moines this year, so this won’t be happening. <br>
The new fiscal year is fast approaching. There will be a few minor manual updates that will go into effect on July 1. We are still awaiting information from the Governor’s office to determine the merit based increase plan for SFY22 I&#39; hoping to have more to share in Coffee Talk next week. . <br>
VR Teams have been re-formed to better align with service areas and make them a little smaller. There will be 3 teams instead of 2, but their goals will remain the same. We want to make sure all clients get services and participate actively in their program. We want clients to build and keep forward momentum. We also want clients to exit the program earning a living wage and on a career path that will lead to financial stability and allow them to achieve their dreams. <br>
Former IDB client, center graduate, and retired stock broker Rich Crawford, visited IDB last week to be interviewed for my new podcast and hold a business class. I’m still editing, but I’m really excited about the wisdom he shared and think it will be helpful to blind people contemplating a any career pathm but particularly in financial advising. <br>

<h2 id="toc_410">AR: Required Password Reset on June 1st</h2>

<p>From Sarah W: Because of security requirements, on Tuesday, June 1st all staff will be asked to reset their passwords.  There will be specific requirements for the new passwords to ensure they are secure.  So be thinking of a secure password to use when you are asked to update.  Here are some password requirements and tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>       Passwords must be at least 8 characters</li>
<li>      Passwords must include at least 1 capital letter, lowercase letter,  number and punctuation/symbol</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_411">Steps for Creating a secure password that is easy to remember</h3>

<ol>
<li><div><pre><code class="language-none">Pick your base word(s). Make it/them longer than 8 letters. Capitalize one or more letters randomly </code></pre></div>

<p>Examples: Funinthesun, Mashedpotatoes, triceratoPs</p></li>
<li><div><pre><code class="language-none">Exchange some of the letters with numbersand punctuation.</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>

<p>Examples: Fun!nth3sun, M8sh3Dp0?8t03S, Tr1(er8t0Ps</p>

<ol>
<li>    Add numbers on the end</li>
</ol>

<p>o   Examples: Fun!nthe3sun01, M8sh3dp0?8t03s01, Tr1(er8t0ps01</p>

<ol>
<li>    Increment the last two numbers every time you hange your password. </li>

<h2 id="toc_412">AR: Fiscal year End Packing Slips   needed from 6/11-7/16</h2>

<p>From Cheri: It’s that time of year again, state fiscal year end.  Please forward any invoices you have for client purchases and anything else to accounting, <a href="mailto:idbaccountspayable@blind.state.ia.us">idbaccountspayable@blind.state.ia.us</a> or dropped them in the Accounting mailbox in the administrative office.  The invoices and or packing slips need to be dated and signed for anything received from 6/11/2021 through 7/16/2021.  If you have any questions, please email or call Jeremiah, Jenny or me.</p>

<h2 id="toc_413">Invoice Process Update</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a process inovation that came from Jenny that will make folks lives a little easier :)</p>

<p>Counselors and managers: if you receive an invoice directly from a vendor and email it to Accounting, please include an “ok to pay” in your email – assuming it is, of course, ok to pay and you have the authority to approve payment.  This would help us out by reducing the number of emails we have to send and keep track of, and it would help you out by not having to send us an extra email!  Everyone wins!</p>

<h2 id="toc_414">From the desk of Kim Barber</h2>

<p>Susan Howard and Mark Edge coordinated and delivered a two-day Community-Based Training (CBT) on May 25th and 27th here at our Department. There were six IL clients who participated. Mary Clark, a former IDB employee, volunteered help as an IL mentor for both days. Connie Mendenhall was also present to assist with this training for both days. Clients expressed positive gains from the training including the opportunity to build new founded friendships. Thank you to all of our IL teachers and Mary for helping to make this training successful, to our OC for the use of the kitchen facilities, and anyone else I might have not mentioned here that dedicated time and energy in some capacity. Positive progress was made as a result of this training so thank you to all!    </p>

<p>I had a ball at the end of year YATP dinner on Thursday night. My day had started with a 7:00 a.m. presentation to the Cedar Rapids Sunrise Rotarty over Zoom, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d have much energy left. But Brett  the laughter and great stories the students and staff told really energized me. I had encouraged them to TP Quinn&rsquo;s office and they decided they should hit my office too. There are pictures at the bottom o this message. A lot of times blind kids get left out of these kinds of fun high school activities, so it was really cool to see them want to do this. I worked form home on Friday, so get the joy of beholding their handiwork first thing Monday :)</p>

<p>We received the budget amount we requested and the Governor recommended in HF868 which passed late Wednesday night. What a big relief! A big thanks to Cheri, Kim, Alyssa, Sarah w., and Janice for all their work on this during this legislative season. </p>

<p>In order to get BEP fully on track more quickly and then have time to expand our efforts around self-employment both in BEP and VR, Kathy is transitioning out of the role  of heading up facilities. I will be overseeing facilities and the maintenance team for the near future and evaluating how to proceed  with this team&rsquo;s leadership over the next few months.</p>

<h4 id="toc_493">AR: Set up Your OKTA by  June 1.</h4>

<p>The State of Iowa is now using Okta for multifactor authentication. This should make it harder to lose or forget passwords and less likely that your account will be compromised. So while it might feel like a bit of a hassle right now, it is a good thing. Currently, the only thing you need to use this for is your Iowa Web Warrants login. This is where you go to look at your pay stubs and get your leave balance information. When time sheets are moved over to Workday in a couple of months, you will also need to use this to access Workday. This is why it is really important that you get on now and get your web warrants set up. None of us want to  be dealing with this at the same time we are learning to use Workday. Below are the steps for this process.  It looks like a lot, but it&rsquo;s not as complicated as it seems. If you have questions, talk to Craig or Wes. </p>

<h2 id="toc_494">Part 1: Login to Web Warrants</h2>

<li>If you do not remember your password, click &ldquo;the forgot password&rdquo; link. Your account ID is your IDB email address.<br></li>
<li>Complete the login process and make sure you can view your latest pay stub.  Note your password, then go to part 2 when you&rsquo;re ready. </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure by now most folks have seen the updated mask guidance from the CDC. The city of Des Moines is continuing its mask requirements and we will continue to abide by them. However, we know this will be discontinued at some point and want to plan for this. we want to have a working environment where folks feel comfortable. We want to ensure that no one is shamed, harassed, or looked down upon for wearing a mask even when it is not required. In order for me, in consultation with the leadership team, to do the next round of revision to our guidelines, I&rsquo;m asking you to take a few minutes to answer a very short anonymous survey. Please only complete it once :) and please complete it   by noon on May 18th.  </p>

<p>Tiny Habits + the small changes that change everything by BJ Fog<br>
Summary:  The founder of Stanford University&rsquo;s Behavior Design Lab looks at human habits and how small changes can lead to large results.

<h2 id="toc_508">Calling all clients interested in Photography and/videography</h2>

<p>From Sarah B.: I have a former coworker who knows a videographer and is blind.  I am interested to know if any client would be interested in attending a zoom session to connect with this person to ask questions and learn about how they perform their duties. I am not sure if it will look like an informational interview or just a presentation yet. It depends on the amount of clients interested.  If people could email me by May 17th if they have a client that is interested.</p>

Questions:  Contact Denise Bean</p>

<p>##Terri Wilcox&rsquo;s  Self-Advocacy Seminars Update<br>
Because calling the groups that Terri leads &ldquo;support groups&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really capture what they were and the name was causing some confusion, we decided to give them a new title. Terri does a great job running these meetings like a business class and we wanted folks to understand her emphasis on community building through the building of self-advocacy skills and a positive-attitude toward blindness. Also, while support groups are generally open to all, these groups serve only current VR and IL clients. We settled on the name Self-Advocacy Seminars. We liked that it also made the acronym SAS and it helped folks become their sassy, empowered selves :).  The new flyer is attached. A big thanks to Cindy and Terri for putting the flyer together. </p>

<h2 id="toc_509">Gifts and Bequests Guidelines</h2>

<p>Here is the link to the guidelines. Please let me know if you have any general questions or contact Jeremiah for questions about the application form itself.  Reading through he guidelines should help clarify what kinds of things tend to be covered. </p>

You may scan and email the mileage report to Jeremiah and then mail the original report to accounting.  Be sure to fully complete the report including the top line with the vehicle number, the license plate #, and your name.  The form to record your mileage is available on the IDB intranet in the Travel section and you can print as many as you like and even print them double sided if you want. In addition, this form should be available in your vehicle binder. We need this information to enter the report in the State of Iowa Accounting System.</p>

<p>From the center: Troy completed his final meal which consisted of porcupine meatballs, angel hair pasta, cheddar bay biscuits, and Watergate salad for dessert.  Veronica successfully completed her drop-off, and students are planning their activity for next Thursday morning while center staff are in Team Fest.  The students also used Fridays business class to speak with one of the sorority’s from Drake University about blindness, and answered many of the questions and misconceptions around blindness that they have.  Plans are continuing to move forward with the collaboration between the students in the Orientation Center and ArtForce Iowa.  Soon we will be doing a clay sculpture workshop focusing on interpretive art.  We have also let them know the braille at the sculpture park is not correct and they have notified the people to get it fixed.</p>

<p>IDB will host testing for the National Certification in Unified English Braille (NCUEB) on September 10th. This is a certification of braille competency held by many teachers of braille across the country. Unfortunately, State of Iowa policy will not allow IDB to pay for staff certifications, so even if you feel obtaining this certification would be good for you in your job,  IDB  is not allowed to pay.

<h2 id="toc_522">Director Updates</h2>

<p>There has been no detectable movement on our appropriation bills this wee. </p>

<p>Next week we are hoping to have a new flyer for Terri&rsquo;s braille groups. We are re-branding the business class portion of the meetings. Support groups give folks too much of an open ended and social impression. While the groups are quite social, they are really more like business classes in the center. We thought a better way to get this across to folks is to refer to them as self-advocacy seminars. Not only is SAS a fun acronym :), but it also gives a much better description of their purpose and. More info about this will be shared next week. <br>
I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing everyone virtually on Friday at our quarterly All Staff meeting. </p>

<h2 id="toc_532">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Cheri: When I was working with city of Des Moines staff on our ramp project, the man I was talking to said that his mother was a client and  Mark did a wonderful job helping her to regain her independence. He share that Mark was helpful and provided great service.</p>

<h2 id="toc_533">Another Sad Passing</h2>

<p>From Mark: , I received a phone call from Jo Slayton this morning.  She wanted to notify the Department of the death of Manuel Urena.  He was the director of the Orientation Center in the 1960’s.  He died on Saturday, April 17, 2021, in Sacramento, California.</p>

<h2 id="toc_534">Director Updates</h2>

<p>We had the building naming task force on Wednesday. No one was willing to serve as chair and the 6 folks assembled wanted to try again. There will be another attempt at 5:30 on May 13th. I&#39;lll get the info out next week. </p>

<p>The House bill is on the daily debate calendar but no movement on the Senate bill as of this writing. i was really grateful to hear from Jim Omvig, Joe Van Lent, Craig Dykemann, and Roger Erpelding about the letters they sent to Senators.</p>

<p>We put out a IL Updates newsletter with the new PSAs and some profiles of the folks who voiced the adds. You can also find this on the front page of our website. </p>

<p>I am working on putting together a podcast where I  sit down and talk with blind folks who are or were in various career fields about their work focusing on how they do their jobs and why they love them. I&rsquo;m looking for ideas on folks to ask to be on the podcast and also questions to ask. What do your clients/patrons or want and need to know about how blind people do their jobs? My goal is to not just help clients feel more informed, about what it takes, but more confident and excited about the joy and meaning one gets from doing work that is real. One of my all-time favorite poems puts this so beautifully:</p>

<h2 id="toc_544">Shout OUt</h2>

<p>From Emily: A big thanks to Hanna and Cindy for tir feedback and quotes for the SELF Week article below. And another bit shout out to YATP student Sam for her copy editing and Chelsea for her help cordinating . This was an awesome group effort and a huge help to me. </p>

<h2 id="toc_545">Thank You Note</h2>

<p>The front of the white card says: Your kind expression of sympathy is gratefully acknowledged and deeply appreciated.  The Family of Michael David Barber.  There is a photo of Michael Barber on the right side.  Hand written on the inside of the card:  Dear IDB Staff:  Thank you for the Gift Basket, the heartfelt sympathies and thoughts at the time of the loss of Michael.  With deep appreciation – Kim.</p>

<h2 id="toc_546">From the Center:</h2>

<p>Adam and Blane started the center this week and are setteling in. Troy was accepted in to the NOMC program towards the goal of teaching cane travel and he is really excited about it. The center staff and students met with Christine Her, Executive Director with ArtForce Iowa to start working towards a collaboration in the downtown area.</p>

<h2 id="toc_547">Director Updates</h2>

<p>The Senate released it&rsquo;s appropriation bill and it has $263,723 less than the House for IDB The House version matched the Governor&rsquo;s recommendation. We are asking the Senate  to match the House version.  I&rsquo;ve shared info with the consumer organizations and NFBI has shared with its membership this morning. There is also info up on our website at <a href="https://blind.iowa.gov/ask22">https://blind.iowa.gov/ask22</a>. I know that the Senate amount will not allow us to be able to put a 7th IL teacher the field and in have serious concerns that there will be other damage to the IL program budget if we receive that level of funding. We would make it work and do everything we can minimize impact on clients, but I don&rsquo;t like the chocies that may need to be made. To be totally clear, I have no intention of letting us get below 6 IL teachers again and that would be a last, last resort. Also to be totally clear, under the Senate version, merit based increases would be nearly impossible. That would break my heart as I am still sad that we could not do them this year. Just a reminder that folks aren&rsquo;t allowed to advocate on work time or using work phone/computer.  But this should never be taken as a restriction on   you your right to speak as an Iowan on your own time. </p>

<p>At Director&rsquo;s Forum today, I shared out this info about the budget and Kim shared about the collaboration with the University ofIowa regarding access technology needs of older individuals who are blind that she and her team have been working on. My meeting with the affiliate Presidents was moved to next Wednesday. I spoke to the ICUB DSM chapter on Monday night. They had good questions about the center name change and the building naming task force. I&rsquo;m going to be talking about IDB to Commisioner Brems&rsquo;s Rotary Club on May 13th. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on a podcast where I speak with blind folks who are employed about their jobs past and present. I&rsquo;m working to interview Rich Crawford, former financial manager and center grad at the end of May. I&rsquo;ll be reaching out for ideas of more folks to interview. I am hoping to be able to stream these live as well as record to allow for audience questions, but this is just in the development stages.</p>

<h2 id="toc_548">SELF Weeks Accelerate VR Clients Training</h2>

<p>While coming to the center is the most efficient and comprehensive method for mastering the skills that blind people need to be successful in employment, there are a variety of reasons why people can&rsquo;t attend the center. This is why we have Vocational Rehabilitation Teachers (VRTs) who travel the state to work with VR clients in their communities. While this is very helpful to clients in moving forward toward their vocational goals, the lack of community and time between teacher visits are  definite downsides to this training model. In order to  give VR clients the opportunity to come together for a week of intensive training, the Education and Training Team  created SELF Weeks. DuringSELF Weeks, VR clients get as much in person instructional time with VR Teachers and Rehabilitation Technology Specialists as they could get in a year of home visits. SELF Week participants work on their training goals daily, join in evening activities, and attend daily blindness discussion seminars with Center students. </p>

<p>clients come to SELF Week with a wide range of skills and abFupcoming<br>
 ilities. They also bring a lot of things they want to work on. For one person, ordering your own coffee at a downtown coffee shop might be something totally new and challenging while for someone else it might be making a soup or conquering a tech challenge. As one participant put it: &ldquo;I appreciate how the staff is able to recognize the different levels each of us is at and help us grow at our own pace.&rdquo; one of the staff instructors shared the observation: &ldquo;One of the coolest things to see were the relationships that developed between people. Another instructor commented: &quot;The growth I saw in the individuals from the beginning to the end of the week was HUGE and each of the clients I worked with could identify that they had accomplished things during this week that they never dreamed they&rsquo;d could accomplish .. When they left they held their heads higher and saw themselves as a more independent person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the other highlights that participants have reported include: </p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Finding out how quickly I picked up some of the skills and staff support on growing those skills.&rdquo;<br></li>
<li>&ldquo;Finally being able to get over stairs during cane travel.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;listening to everyone&rsquo;s stories&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My Braille class where I got progressively faster at reading compared to before this week and even at the beginning of this week. I&rsquo;m honestly very proud of myself for improving as fast as I did, even though it&rsquo;s only been though a week.&rdquo;</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Meeting more people with blindness&rdquo;</p>

<p>March 15-19, 2021 IDB held our fourth SeLF  Week trainings. Ten clients attended. We anticipate that the number of participants will continue to rise as COVD-19 becomes less of a challenge. During the pandemic, clients have stayed in hotels to allow for better distancing. We are hopeful that clients will be able to return to staying in the IDB building during the first fall session. In 2022, we will be adding a fourth session in the summer. If you are a VR client and would like to participate in an upcoming SELF Week, speak with your VR counselor or teacher. </p></li>

<h2 id="toc_549">IDB Polo’s</h2>

<p>There are a few of us that have decided we want to order more polo’s. If you would like to order more, or for those who didn’t order and wished you would have, I’m going to place another order. Let me know by Friday April 23rd by the end of the business day. The price will still be the same at $25.00.

<p>From Sarah W.: The IDB Staff Read book club is still a go!  We will meet on Tuesday, May 18th from 12-1 pm via Zoom to discuss the books.  We want to give everyone a chance to get started on the reading the book.  Use the Zoom information below to join the discussion on May 18th.  You can choose to read one or both books. The two books we will be discussing are:</p>

<p>Tiny Habits + the small changes that change everything by BJ Fogg<br>
Summary:  The founder of Stanford University&rsquo;s Behavior Design Lab looks at human habits and how small changes can lead to large results. His model states that behavior happens when motivation, ability, and an external prompt converge at the same time. Breaking bad habits relies on starting small.<br>
This book is available in Braille and audio (on BARD – DB98294).  Please see Leslie to request the Braille copy.</p>

<p>Designing your work life: how to thrive and change and find happiness at work by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans.<br>
Summary: Burnett and Evans demonstrate how to build positive change wherever you are in your career. Design thinking can transform your present job, and your experience of work in general, by utilizing curiosity, reframing, radical collaboration, awareness, prototyping, and storytelling. <br>
This book is available in Braille and audio.  We are working on getting the audio on BARD.  But for now, we are able to put it on a cartridge for you, please see Leslie.  Also contact Leslie to request the Braille copy.</p>

<p>From Drew: I just wanted to give a shout out to Martha. You asked the question at a quarterly 2 years ago, “What is service?” Martha is the perfect example of this. No matter if it is a client or coworker. I called her out of the blue about a client’s loaner and she stepped in and helped out immediately with a smile and an earnest attitude to help fix. Not just towards my client, but towards me as well. She goes beyond her role every time I interact with her and has a great passion in what she does.</p>

<h2 id="toc_566">BEP Update</h2>

<p>From Kathy: Roxy and Matt are getting vendors excited about using telemetry from credit card readers (online data collection and analysis of sales) which should save vendors time, energy and money. BEP has picked up two locations and has four more in the works to create opportunities for vendors after a year of remote-working-related downturns in sales. Partnering with IDB helps make work easier – recently a vendor spoke up to say that he had no Wi-Fi access and we were able to get him connected with a phone call. Thank you, IDB staff, for thinking about blind people you know who have a go-getter initiative personality, are eager to keep up with the times, have the ability to learn to do business using computers, are willing to give and take working with BEP and have a great customer service sense. We are working on the training curriculum this Spring and Summer.</p>

<h2 id="toc_574">Jim Witte Obituary</h2>

<p>Leonard James “Jim” Witte entered<br>
into eternal rest on March 31, 2021 at age 89. Jim’s<br>
life journey took him from his birth in Des Lacs,<br>
North Dakota, on June 18, 1931, to farming with<br>
his family in Hebron, ND, to service in the U.S. Air<br>
Force during the Korean War. While stationed in<br>
Washington, D.C., Jim met and married Cecelia<br>
Thoma Witte. They moved to Iowa in 1953 to begin<br>
their 47-year marriage and to raise their family. In<br>
Iowa, Jim completed two degrees in education at<br>
Drake University, a stint as a public school teacher<br>
in Audubon, and ultimately a career in teaching and<br>
management at the Orientation Center, operated by the Iowa Department<br>
for the Blind. There Jim redirected the lives of 750 or more blind Iowans<br>
and others encouraging them to adopt a positive attitude about blindness,<br>
to believe that, “It is okay to be blind.” Transformed by this attitude blind<br>
Iowans went on to successfully pursue their dreams and, through their<br>
achievements, work to convince a sighted world of that same belief.<br>
Jim interrupted his teaching career from 1968 to 1976 at the invitation of<br>
his brother, John, joining him to operate a local bank in Poplar, Montana.<br>
Throughout his careers, Jim served on multiple boards ranging from a<br>
local school board to parish councils, to diocesan committees and consumer<br>
or service councils affiliated with organizations of the blind.<br>
Jim was preceded in death by his parents, Theodore and Clementine;<br>
his ten older siblings, Victor, Myrl (Sister Clementine), Mark, Kenny, Inez,<br>
Cora (Sister Muriel), Cyril, John, Marian, and Eunice (Sister Monica),<br>
son-in-law (Randy Criswell), and his wife Cecelia. Jim’s immediate family<br>
who will long cherish his memory, include his wife Catherine, daughter<br>
Becky Criswell (Mike Olsen), son Mark (Cathy), daughter Melanie (Maggie<br>
Dugan), son Ted, and grandchildren Travis Witte (Kailyn), Grant Witte<br>
(Annie), Rachel Nash (Kevin), Andy Schutz (Teresa), Katie Hill (Brian),<br>
Joey Schutz (Chanda), Kevin Schutz, Sean Witte and Grace Witte together<br>
with great-grandchildren Sula Witte, Lauren and Elizabeth Schutz, Kaylee<br>
Kovacovich and Cecelia Miller-Schutz, and baby Nash who will arrive this<br>
summer, as well as numerous nieces and nephews and their families.<br>
Viewing will be open to the public at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday April 8,<br>
2021 at St. Boniface Catholic Church, Waukee, Iowa followed by the Mass<br>
of Christian Burial at 10:30 a.m. Burial will follow in St. Mary’s Cemetery,<br>
Dallas Center, Iowa.<br>
The service will be live streamed for those unable to attend. A link will<br>
appear around 10:15 a.m., (just prior to the service) on Jim’s obituary page<br>
at <a href="http://www.Ilescares.com">www.Ilescares.com</a>, where you may also leave online condolences.<br>
Memorial contributions may be designated to St. Boniface Church, Sudan<br>
Relief Fund or Iowans for Life.</p>

 From Facilities, this is a transition week with equipment for Spring as temperatures are spiking, and yet we are in April when it is sure to snow. The chiller is getting going today.

<h2 id="toc_583">Remember to lock doors that You have unlocked</h2>

<p>Third floor doors are being left unlocked on the weekend. If you are coming in to work, you need to make double sure the main stairwell doors remain locked. Thanks much </p>

<p>##Thank You<br>
I wanted to give a big thank you to everyone involved in this year&rsquo;s Braille Challenge. Matt did a great job hosting and Tyler did professional production as always. I know Karen C., Roxanne, Jerry did a ton of work behind the scenes. And also a big thanks to everyone who helped and supported this substantial undertaking in so many ways. This year added a little extra challenge and made it so a lot of folks who would like to be there and cheer on the students and braille literacy couldn&rsquo;t do that in the way we are used to doing. I am really hopeful that next year will present more opportunities for everyone to celebrate and promote braille.</p>

<h2 id="toc_584">Updated In Person Rules and Guidelines</h2>

<p>The leadership team has been working really hard to update our in person rules and guidelines document. It is attached and will be up on our website. We are adjusting to changes in the situation and trying to make it a bit shorter and easier to follow. The two biggest take aways that I hope folks get is that masks are still very much necessary, important, and required and that we trust folks to use their good judgment. If you have questions, please reach out to your supervisor or myself. </p>

<p>Here is how the front page of our website has been updated:</p>

<p>All staff and members of the public, with the exception of anyone age 2 and under, are required to wear face masks in the IDB building as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). If a person is unwilling or unable to wear a mask, they should continue to do business via phone and email. IDB is committed to protecting its employees, clients, patrons, and the public during the pandemic.<br>
 our main door is unlocked and front desk is staffed Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. If you are needing assistance with entry to the building between 8:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. - 4:30 p.m., please call 515-452-1335. <br>
To make a referral, you may call 800–362–2587 or complete the referral form to contact the library, call 515-281-1323.</p>

<h2 id="toc_585">Director Updates</h2>

<p>I apologize for not being more clear in communicating . about thisAfter Ann&rsquo;s retirement, Keri, Kim, and I decided to revise how IL and VR work with referrals. In looking at the overall needs of the agency, we found that  the biggest need  we had was for more support for ETT, iL, and VR staff. This is why we are posting a Secretary 1 position. This position will support VR and BEP. Sara T. will be able to devote her time to ETT and the Center.  Counselors will be completing more of the applications and IL will have an AARP trainee to assist Alyssa. We are hopeful this will increase the level of support for staff and help us to better serve clients. The posting for this Secretary 1 position went up 4/2 and is linked in the Job Openings section below. </p>

<p>I also got a question about the Flower Fund and thought it would be a good time to share out how it works and  also put in a plug for contributions. If Generally events that cause a flower fund response are shared with your supervisor and your supervisor will report it to Janice. Please do also let your supervisor know if you would like info shared in Coffee Talk. Sometimes it will happen that someone doesn&rsquo;t want info shared and we respect that. Occasionally I will forget to include info in Coffee Talk. If I do, i&rsquo;m really sorry. Regardless of whether it is in Coffee Talk, Janice will get the cards, flowers, care baskets, etc. sent out as soon as she has the info.  eHere are the guidelines that were added to the new General information Section at the end of our manual. </p>

<p>Flower Fund</p>

<p>The flower fund is an employee funded fund that pays for flowers, gift cards, or cards being sent to employees in certain situations. The rules are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cards sent anytime and to all who should be remembered—staff, family members, volunteers, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>In case of hospitalization—flowers or plants will be sent to employees only. </p></li>
<li><p>In case of death—flowers, plants or memorials will be sent for employees, employees’ spouses, employees’ children or step-children, or employees’ parents.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_586">Passing of Long-Time IDB Staff</h2>

<p>Mark was kind enough to share with me that Jim Witte passed away earlier this week. Jim worked for many years at IDB , a large number of those in the center. I will always  remember talking with Jim between sessions  at an ICUB convention. Shawn and I listened  attentively as Jim recounted the story of how our building  was acquired. I was grateful to have this opportunity to hear the story directly from him. Jim was one of the folks moving stuff in and getting squaters&#39; rights. He played many other important roles in building our agency to world class status in the 60s and 70s. We have not yet  been able to locate an obituary or funeral info. There is a card if folks would like to sign on the glass case by the East door. </p>

<h2 id="toc_587">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From the Center:  Josh and Troy both completed drop offs, and Steve completed one of his small meals.  We have also acquired one more apartment that is ADA compliant at Jackson Crossing for students in the center.</p>

<h2 id="toc_594">AR: Don’t forget to run Mobile Iron!</h2>

<p>From Wes: If you are converted over to our Mobile Iron system, this is my semi-frequent reminder to please open up the app occasionally. This will allow it to sync with our server and track your phone more efficiently. Additionally, please ensure that Location Services for mobile Iron are enabled. If you are still fairly new to the system, you might get a popup saying “Mobile Iron has used your location XXX times in the last YYY days. Choose “Always” in this box. You can also make this change in Settings. Open up Settings, then scroll to Mobile Iron Go and activate it. Under the “Allow Mobile Iron Go to Access” heading, ensure that Location says “Always”. If it does not, tap on Location and switch it to Always. Once you do this, you might get the popup I referenced earlier and you can say “Always” at that time. We need location to be set to always so that we can find and deal with lost phones.</p>

<h2 id="toc_595">AR: If you hav any IDB owned braille displays in your possession</h2>

<p>From Helen: We are conducting an audit of IDB braille displays. If you have any braille displays, such as a Focus, QBraille, U2 Mini or Polaris Mini, assigned to you, either for your use as an employee or for client training, please send Wes the serial number and IDB tag number by April 5.</p>

<h2 id="toc_598">AR: Email Announcements to All Staff</h2>

<p>It is really hard to keep the right balance between sharing information but not overwhelming everyone&rsquo;s inbox. I know we all get a ton of emails on a daily basis and it can get pretty time consuming to go through them all. To try to help with this, please use the below guidelines in determining if something should be sent to the all staff email or to be put in Coffee Talk. I know i haven&rsquo;t always been the most thoughtful about this and will be working to do better. Please do let me know if you catch me not following these guidelines. I appreciate direct feedback, but you can always send me an anonymous message through this Wufoo form: <a href="https://iowadeptblind.wufoo.com/forms/m23pwsy13y4kka/">Anonymous Feedback or Question Form</a></p>

<h3 id="toc_599">Things That Should Go To All Staff</h3>

<ul>
<li>It effects the work or workday of many or all staff.</li>
<li> It cannot wait til the upcoming Monday when Coffee Talk will be read by all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of this may include new staff when the acceptance letter was not received until the day of start, passing away or severe illness of staff or staff close family members that the staff person wants shared or related cards and funeral arrangements, elevators or networks/servers being down,  or water being shut off, etc. </p>

<h3 id="toc_600">Things To Put In Coffee Talk</h3>

<ul>
<li>events and fundraisers that will not end before the next Monday</li>
<li>external resources that could benefit most or all staff or those they serve and won&rsquo;t end before the next Monday.</li>
<li>Shout outs, success stories, updates on events that have happened or things that will be upcoming.</li>

<h2 id="toc_601">Welcome Lori Berglund</h2>

<p>On behalf of Kim, I am very excited  to announce that Lori Berglund will be starting as a new IL Teacher on Tuesday (3/30). She lives in Storm Lake and will be covering northcentral Iowa. She comes to us from Buena Vista University where she worked with undergraduates in the Student Success Center. She will be beginning her center staff training on Tuesday,.   </p>

<h2 id="toc_602">Braille Babies Update</h2>

<p>From Denise: It is always pretty neat when you are able to share some &ldquo;news&rdquo; about your Youth Library! It is very clear to all of us how important Braille is, and how Braille directly correlates with literacy and the future success of our children that are blind. As of today, we have 5 children signed up for Braille Babies! The best part, parents also want to learn more about braille too!</p>

<p>Several others have helped tremendously with this process. Sarah (the one that I always collaborate with and gets the ball rolling, if you can only imagine that LOL! Tyler, the movie producer, wow, he makes magic happen all the time! Karen, who added her finesse to the future Braille Babies Alphabet book. Nami and Erin that are going to be a part of future filming! Erin doesn&rsquo;t realize it yet, but he just may be the star of the show! </p>

<p>Yep, Braille Babies takes a lot of people working together! I guess today seemed like the perfect time to share a little Braille news! Mr. Barber had such a passion for children and Braille, knowing that we have 5 children signed up for Braille Babies would put a big smile on his face!   </p>

<h2 id="toc_603">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Al:   Troy had his third meal and Steve completed a drop off.  I failed to mention that last week Kevin H started in the center so if you see him around please say hello. </p>

<p>The picture and description of Veronica&rsquo;s shop project is at the end of the email.</p>

<h2 id="toc_604">Director Updates</h2>

<p>I  had some conversations with Steve Gettle, Superintendent of IESBVI this week. They were really open and thoughtful discussions that I hope will lead to better collaboration at the management level. We are looking at ways to support staff in the field collaborating as well. </p>

<p>TheClient and Staff Safety Workgroup is continuing to work hard at tackling tough questions. I really appreciate the thoughtfulness and effort folks are putting into this project. </p>

<p>Al and I did host a Center name listening session Wednesday night. While we got some great ideas,  I forgot to send out a GovDelivery and so it was less attended than we had hoped. I have been asked to offer another session. This will be Wednesday, April 7 at 5:30. Connection info is below. This is not a work activity and would need to be done on one&rsquo;s own time. I plan to allow time for staff brainstorming at the April 7. All Agency Chat if folks would be interested in brainstorming then. Here is the info for the public session to share:  </p>

<h2 id="toc_605">Weather Tracking Apps</h2>

<p>From Wes: In light of both Iowa and Nebraska’s Severe Weather Awareness Week happening right now, I have placed the American Red Cross’s Tornado app in our Mobile Iron App Catalog and also it is in the purchased apps on the old ID. Tornado is a location-aware app that will let you monitor fixed locations as well as alert you to hazards as you move around. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of other weather apps, but will let you know of severe thunderstorm watches and warnings, and Tornado watches and warnings. The Tornado warning alert is a very loud siren; the Thunderstorm and watch alerts are more subtle. You can find it in the App Catalog under the Weather or Utilities category or perform a search for “Tornado”.<br>

<h2 id="toc_611">Center Updates</h2>

<p>Its always bitter sweet to have students graduate.  They work so hard in the center for so long and become part of the community here.  This week Joy successfully completed the center, and we celebrated her accomplishment on Thursday.  Enrique is finally getting a chance to finish his project in shop this week and spending a little time learning some machines in the shop that he did not get a chance to use 5 years ago.  </p>

<p>There is a picture and description of Olivia (VR intern) and her picture frame at the bottom of this email..</p>

<h2 id="toc_612">Director&rsquo;s Updates</h2>

<p>It occurred to me that I had completely forgot to share the changes in the building apartment staff. Jen B. and Zach and his wife, Jenny, have moved into their own places. Jim Cummings has moved into the 6th floor apartment and Jodi has moved into the large apartment on 5th. The apartments on the north side are being used by the YATP folks. </p>

<p>As we are coming up on the one year anniversary of the pandemic response, I just wanted to take a moment and thank everyone for all of the work you all put in during such a challenging time. There are those of us who lost loved ones and have had to deal with indescribable loss in the midst of all this stress and uncertainty. While things are looking brighter, we aren&rsquo;t entirely out of the woods yet and need to keep doing as we have been doing. We are looking toward the future and how we may be able to be more open and flexible while keeping everyone as safe and comfortable as possible. I know we will all continue to be  kind and compassionate toward ourselves and those around us. You have demonstrated such beautiful resilience, I know we will make it these last few miles.  </p>

Here is another piece of info that was shared: &ldquo;for Hy-Vee you can go to <a href="http://www.hyvee.com/covid">www.hyvee.com/covid</a> to get to the sign up spot; however, when I tried that I kept getting an error message when I entered in my zip code.

<p>Please do remember to share with clients, drivers, and others coming to our building that we are still requiring masks in our building.

Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="toc_628">Center Updates</h2>

<p>Steve completed a small meal and the whole center returned to Jordan Creek Mall on Friday for a shaded day out. Last week the students encountered storekeepers who did not want blind people entering their store and security guards trying to boss them around, so a return trip to perform some public education was in order. While this is never enjoyable, this This is a great opportunity for staff trainees to get to see first hand and experience the mistreatment and  discrimination that blind people have to deal with in our daily lives. It is also important for students to get to practice dealing with these situations as constructively as possible. If anyone didn&rsquo;t get to experience this sort of thing during their staff training, talk to your supervisor and  we would be happy to work on arranging a further training opportunity.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_629">Director Updates</h2>

<p>As much as I would like to say otherwise, I&rsquo;m afraid we need to make a decision for planning purposes and at this time, we need to be on the side of caution and say that the May all staff meetings will be held virtually. It is my plan and belief that we will have the August meeting in person, but looking at the trends on vaccinations at this time, it isn&rsquo;t clear that there will be widespread availability in Polk County by May. Folks have asked if there was any further word from the state on employee vaccinations. Director Garcia did communicate with agency heads but no new information or availability was shared. I would continue to encourage folks to work with their health care provider and acquire the vaccine through non-employer based sources if you can. I really wish I were telling you something different and I am really disappointed that none of our staff  were  included in state of Iowa 1b allocations. </p>

<p>I was asked to write an article for the upcoming ICUB Bulletin. It was very hard to not write 30 pages with the amount of interesting and news worthy things folks are doing. I wish I could have included it all. I also struggled in editing myself while writing this year&rsquo;s library of the year award nomination letter. Here is the text  of it:</p>

<p>On February 16th, I presented our state appropriation request to the legislative appropriation subcommittee. In this presentation I stated, :We have the best library for the blind int the country and I am willing to arm wrestle anyone who says otherwise.&ldquo; I then wen on to outline what our library has done throughout this extraordinarily challenging year. First of all, we did not lose a single day of sending out books to patrons or providing educational materials to preK-12 students. Secondly, the library team increased the number of books on a cartridge from 10 to 20 to ensure that clients would continue to have books if there were a need for mailing or processing delays. Thirdly, the library team quickly spun up two great new programs. Anticipating that older patrons may experience isolation, they worked with two volunteer narrators to set up a weekly program to read westerns and cozy mysteries over the phone and have discussions with patrons. They also created online training for para-educators designed to help them to create accessible materials, order materials, understand access technology basics, and learn braille.   Thirty-six para-educators across the state participated in the two sessions and blind students will benefit from improved support  for  years  to come. The library is now working with our Area Education Agencies to make this training available to hundreds of educators through their learning management system. Beyond this, library staff and Americorps volunteers took the summer reading program for public libraries virtual, hosted a STEM teacher extern and are preparing to host two teacher externs this summer.  The Braille Bits podcast and training materials  are helping sighted educators and family members in Iowa and across the country learn braille. Our Books for Kids program and new Braille Babies program is helping put blind children   on the path to literacy. In addition, the library rolled out the braille reader pilot to 120 users. I have heard from patrons how pleased they have been with the ereaders themselves and the speed and efficiency of the roll out. </p>

<p>I could go on and on about the programs and services our library has either built or strengthened over this year. I understand that Iowa is a small state and we have a small library compared to so many others. However, our library is mighty and its impact is huge. Its heart is even bigger. Our library team cares deeply about literacy and words every day to make sure that blind Iowans of all ages have access to information and the tools needed to compete on terms of equality with their sighted  peers.    Our Instructional Materials Center fights bureaucracy and low expectations to ensure that blind students have high-quality, timely books, worksheets, and tactiles. On top of all this, the library oversees our front desk and internal tech support for the entire agency. They are building an outstanding YouTube presence that benefits all our programs as well as blind persons, educators, employers, and families across the globe. They are always striving, iterating, and collaborating with other parts of our agency, but the level to which they have taken their innovation during this most challenging year is just incredible.  I would not trade our library director or team for that of any library five times our size.   </p>

<p>We are presenting at 9:00 on Tuesday to the House Education Appropriation Subcommittee. We were asked not to bring power points, but the handouts can be found at: <a href="https://blind.iowa.gov/house-education-appropriation-subcommittee-presentation-handouts-2021-2-16">https://blind.iowa.gov/house-education-appropriation-subcommittee-presentation-handouts-2021-2-16</a><br>

Earlier this week, the Des Moines Register published another article involving IDB and NFBI. It was primarily focused on NFB’s partnership with RAIN and their formation of a survivor lead task force. However, the Register article did not clearly represent our organization. We have had instances of sexual harassment, like many other state agencies, but there has not been sexual violence or assault. The reporter misnamed our agency and conflated it with the National Federation of the Blind. They made things that have happened in other parts of the country appear as though they were happening here. I tried to explain to the reporter that while we work with both the Iowa Council of the United Blind and NFB, we are a state agency and are completely separate from these organizations. I am disappointed and frustrated by this article in that, it appeared to me in our conversation . The reporter was determined to paint blind people as inherently more vulnerable than anyone else and I was not able to convince her otherwise. I feel quite strongly that this is insulting and does a great disservice to blind people, particularly young blind women. While we all need to know our boundaries and how to protect them, a blind person who has blindness skills, self-worth, and self-confidence is no more vulnerable than their sighted peers. I kept trying to get across the fact all blind people are different and come to our agency with different life experiences. We work with folks where they are at and help them get all the life skills they need. I did agree that the widespread belief that it is OK to just walk up and grab a blind person or push or pull us is a huge challenge for blind people, especially blind youth. But his is a public attitude problem and outside of the narrative the reporter was determined to create. The reporter wanted to tell the age old story that blind people are all child-like and in need of protection from the big bad sighted world. This is a false narrative and it is very unfortunate that we will need to keep fighting to tell the real story – the story of independent, confident, and empowered blind people striving and thriving amongst their sighted peers. <br>
Sorry I wrote last week that Director’s Forum was last Friday, it is this Friday at noon. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone virtually on Friday at our quarterly All Staff meeting. <br>

The video that will be discussed in May is included on this webpage for folks who like to work ahead. More information about May’s discussions will be shared in coming weeks. But there is no new video you need  to  watch before Friday. Below is the list of questions we will be working on in our small group breakouts on this Friday. The groups will be mostly the same except there was a mixup with folks coming back in to a different group and we have a few new folks to mix in. Please feel free to skip around on the questions and work at your own pace. You are not required to get through all the questions, the goal is to learn and share and get better at having crucial conversations by practicing talking about less than comfortable topics. In May, we will have a new video and a new set of questions. But please do feel free to let me or your supervisor know if there are questions you want brought back or added. Also please do let me know if you have wanted to participate in the All Agency Chats on the second and fourth Tuesdays but that time never works for you and then please do suggest an alternate time. If you have any questions, please let me know.<br>
What types of crucial conversations do you find it most challenging to undertake?<br>
Are there some crucial conversations you have started that you found to be easier or better than you anticipated?<br>
What ways have you found to prepare for starting a crucial conversation or stop yourself from avoiding a crucial conversation you know you need to have? Any tips or techniques you can share with the group?<br>
Listening to and processing feedback from others is challenging. Most people tend to put ups some sort of defense when someone is bringing them a crucial conversation. What is your “go to” defensive maneuver? What caused you to recognize this? <br>
What do you do to get yourself to listen to feedback with an open mind? Any tips or techniques you can share with the group?<br>
Do you have any tips or techniques to share for ways you try to make yourself more approachable and give others the impression that they can come to you with feedback?<br>
Do you have any examples of times when someone has approached you with feedback in a way that you found really opened up communication?<br>
Think about a time a crucial conversation went well, what do you think we’re the reasons for this?<br>
Think about a time a crucial conversation went badly, what were the reasons things went off the rails?<br>
People don’t come with instruction manuals, but if you did, what would yours say under the heading “Crucial Conversations”?<br>

update: All Agency Chats</p>

<p>A big thanks to Karly for her really great discussion on the TED Talk, “I’m Not Your Inspiration…” I almost wrote that Karly was just amazing as an inside joke for those who were there :), but she really did lead the discussion well and speaking for myself, I feel like I learned a lot. We will be coming up with more topics for future discussions on the 26th. and beyond. If you have suggestions for videos, podcasts, or articles please share them with the members of the Communication Team. The team members are: Drew, Karly, Kelsi, Jennifer K., Jim, Joe W., Tim, and me. If there is anything you would like the Comm Team to put on our agenda, talk to our chair Karly. <br>

Quote of the Week</p>

<p>“Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment.” – Mahatma Gandhi </p>

<h2 id="toc_635">Joke of the Week</h2>

<p>Do you want to hear a construction joke?<br>
Sorry, I’m still working on it.</p>

<h1 id="toc_636">February 6, 2021</h1>

<h2 id="toc_637">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From a VRT who asked to remain anonymous: Terri Wilcox offers multiple support groups for clients including blind philosophy/discussion and the teaching of braille.  When I visit my clients who are involved in Terri’s support groups I see first-hand the growth and confidence they experience.  This has also given them the opportunity to make personal, supportive connections with other blind individuals.  Terri, thanks for all you do to help our clients!</p>

<h2 id="toc_638">Director Updates</h2>

<p>A big thanks to Martha, Veronica, Jennifer K., Jeremiah, Roxy, Luis Ashley K, K, Kayla, and Pam for their great participation in New Staff Seminar. We had a great week.  We learned a lot and  laughed a lot. Our next New Staff Seminar cohort will be  August 23-27. </p>

<p>I presented to Des Moines University Grand Rounds this week regarding IDB services and how to treat blind patients. the Communications Team met on Thursday and have some great ideas in the hopper. Don&rsquo;t forget about Karlys All Agency Chat (details below) on Tuesday. More chats will be scheduled soon. The Client and Staff Safety Workgroup will meet again on Wednesday 2/10 and Director&rsquo;s Forum will be held at noon on Monday. Check the upcoming events below for the link. </p>

<p>With the change in the Governor&rsquo;s masking requirements, I&rsquo;ve already been asked if anything will change with IDB&rsquo;s masking requirements. The answer is absolutely not. We need to remain vigilant to keep our colleagues and clients as safe as we can. There have been questions about use of face shields only or gators only during SELF week or in the center. Unfortunately, we need to consider the health of the staff and other clients and cannot allow this. If folks have questions, please talk with me or your supervisor. </p>

<p>Just a reminder to send me any success stories that could be shared by 2/9. I will be presenting to the Education Appropriation Subcommittee on February 16th and we need our info to them by the 12th..  </p>

<h2 id="toc_639">Retirement Announcement</h2>

<p>From Kim: As Ann&rsquo;s supervisor, I wish to announce that Ann has announced she will retire on July 8, 2021. I want to congratulate Ann on her 9 years of service) to the Iowa Department for the Blind. I  sincerely appreciate the level of service she has devoted. She takes her responsibilities very seriously and gives her all to getting the work done. Her professionalism is unmatched, as is her work ethic. She truly makes my job easier by doing her job so well. I can honestly say she will be sorely missed; however, I do thank her for the extra time she is giving us to transition the role of Intake Specialist. Again, congratulations, to you Ann! You have truly earned your retirement.</p>

<p>##ERC Fundraiser<br>

<h2 id="toc_645">Reminder: AR/TS: Read and Sign Acknowledgement of Updated Manual by 4:30 pm on Monday, February 1.</h2>

<p>As I shared in December, our draft manual update has become our new manual as of January 1. Because of this, we need everyone to read the manual and then  sign the acknowledgement page. The manual can be found at:<br>
<a href="https://blind.iowa.gov/manual">https://blind.iowa.gov/manual</a></p>

<p>Links to the acknowledgement page are in the table of contents of the manual. You have two options for signing the acknowledgement. You may print and sign the acknowledgement and then give  it to your supervisor   . Alternatively, we have received confirmation from DAS that we can use the below process for submitting the signatures electronically. I would encourage folks to use this method as it is more efficient:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign and date the acknowledgement sheet. electronically.</li>
<li>Email the acknowledgement  to your supervisor</li>
<li>The supervisor saves your email as a PDF.</li>
<li>The supervisor signs and saves  the document  as a PDF.</li>
<li>The supervisor sends the PDF of your email and the acknowledgement PDF to Janice for the personnel file.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any questions, please talk with your supervisor.</p>

<h2 id="toc_646">Please welcome our new interns:</h2>

<p>From Keri: Ayo Davis-Yeboah will be completing an internship experience with our VR program for a few weeks in February. She is currently working toward her Master’s Degree in Rehabilitation and Mental Health Counseling at Drake University.</p>

<p>Alivia Nelson will be interning with our VR program beginning in February and continuing through May. Alivia is currently working toward her Master’s Degree in Rehabilitation Counseling Education at St. Cloud State University.</p>

<p>Both students will begin their internships by participating in the Orientation Center training beginning next week.</p>

<h2 id="toc_647">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From the Center:<br>
Joy completed her final meal on Friday, and Troy completed his first small meal on Wednesday.  I’m happy to report that students have moved to the apartments at Jackson Crossing.  I want to send a big thanks to everyone who worked on this project, of which there are many people to mention.  As we continue to increase the numbers of students in the center in the next year we will continue to aquire more apartments.  We have resumed tours, providing the winter weather does not get in the way, and clients wishing to enter center training should be able to start setting dates immediately.  We still have covid as an issue so flooding the center would not be a good idea, but a slow rise in numbers would be great.</p>

<p>##Director Updates</p>

<p>A big thanks to everyone who sent in stories about dealing with medical professionals as a blind person. They are really helpful and I think will make an impact on the doctors. Also I&rsquo;d like to thank  Al and Cheri and all those involved with getting the partments and getting everyone moved. I was tickled to hear some of the students were one minute late for announcements because they stoppe at Hy-Vee to get coffee. While punctuality is important, it is so awesome to see them doing this sort of ordinary, on the way to work type of things. Also Joy&rsquo;s large meal was great. The chocolate chip cookies had the perfect balance of crispy and soft and if you are looking for a great kale salad recipe, definitely talk to Joy. </p>

<p>Also Kelsi hosted another great All Agency Chat on Tuesday. I&rsquo;ve been so impressed both with the presenters and the participants. If you can, definitely check out the one Karly will be hosting on the 9th (details below). </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to have the kick off for the braille Challenge on Monday night and New Staff Seminar all next week. It&rsquo;s going to be very busy but very fun.</p>

<h2 id="toc_654">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Last week, DHS announced what state employees would be included in the 1B submission to Polk County. None of IDB&rsquo;s categories were included on this list. This means our staff won&rsquo;t be eligible for employer based vaccinations until it is opened up to 1C or possibly even later. the explanation document is attached. I really don&rsquo;t agree with this, but it is what it is. I would encourage anyone to speak with their health care provider to try to get the vaccine as soon as they can through that or any other channel that may be available to you. Hopefully more doses will become available soon. In the mean time, we all need to continue to social distance, wear our masks, and remain vigilant. We really don&rsquo;t want to put our colleagues, our loved ones, and those we serve at risk. Thank you for continuing to be safe and responsible.</p>

<p>The great news of last week was that the Governor has included our full ask in her budget. This is a first and very big step toward being able to support YATP, IL, and our general payroll costs come July. I will be presenting to the House Education Appropriation Subcommittee on February 16th. More information to come. </p>

<p>We have our volunteers and are moving forward setting up our first meeting for the client and staff safety workgroup. I really appreciate Nami, Zach, Ross, Sarah B., Joe W., Ashely w., Monica, and Kasandra for their willingness to undertake this hard but necessary work. Keri and I shared with the workgroup that we cannot discussed personnel issues past or present, so we will focus on the hypothetical scenarios in order to have frank and open discussion in our  workgroup. </p>

<p>Some folks may have seen the article in the Des Moines Register on Friday. I didn&rsquo;t want to fail to acknowledge it to give the perception that I&rsquo;m hiding from it or hiding it. I was as open as I could legally be with the reporter and spoke candidly with her  regarding follow-up questions she had related to some comments made by one of the individuals quoted not related to IDB employees or former employees. I believe strongly in being as transparent as I can, but also need to follow the law. </p>

<p>Last Wednesday at business class, Al, Commissioner Ryan, and I talked with students and staff to get ideas for a possible name change for the center. We all call it the center or some folks who have been around longer call it the &ldquo;OC.&rdquo; But when I&rsquo;m writing up a flyer or presentation, the Adult Orientation &amp; Adjustment Center doesn&rsquo;t give potential students, families, educators, or legislators much of an idea about what the center does or why it is so vital. I discussed this with the ICUB and NFBI presidents at our monthly call and I  then brought the discussion to Director&rsquo;s Forum on Friday. We will continue to brainstorm and collect ideas and feedback. We are looking at holding an evening Zoom public brainstorming session sometime after the budget hearing. Some of the keywords that people liked have included: blindness, individualized, discovery, independence, learning, training, comprehensive. Please send any ideas or thoughts you have to Al or myself. </p>

<h2 id="toc_655">Key Found</h2>

<p>Phil found a key (likely a cabinet key) on 1/8/2021 – a person could identify what it was attached to—found 2’ in front of a filing cabinet outside the small conference room door If this might be yours, please talk to Kathy.. </p>

<h2 id="toc_656">More about the Library Blogs –</h2>

<p>From Sarah W.: Starting next week, I will be inviting all IDB staff to follow our blogs.  You should receive an email that will ask you confirm that you would like to follow each blog.  Please take a minute to finish the process and confirm that you want to follow, so you can receive up to date information from the library and the Instructional Materials Center (IMC).  By confirming to follow our blogs you will receive an email when a new blog post is posted instead of having to check the blogs for information.  The amount of emails that you will receive is minimal.<br>
The library has been working to develop our two blogs to provide information and resources to its users. The “Turning the Pages” library blog provides information on library services, programs and resources to its patrons and the public (<a href="https://iowalibrary.blog">https://iowalibrary.blog</a>). The “Instructional Materials Center” blog provides information, programs and resources to educators, braille transcribers and others who work with students and accessible educational materials (<a href="https://idbimclibrary.blog">https://idbimclibrary.blog</a>). We have a lot going on throughout the library and the staff continue to add amazing resources and content to these blogs.. Feel free to help us spread the word about these resources.  Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<h2 id="toc_658">Update: Upcoming Communication Team All Agency Chat Discussions</h2>

<p>A big thanks to Tim for leading the discussion on &ldquo;The Power of Vulnerability&rdquo; on Tuesday. While he was stepping out of his comfort zone in leading the discussion, he ran it like a pro. nThanks so much to everyone who attended. Not to be too mushy about it, but I was really moved by how folks made themselves vulnerable and the connection that this created.  Don&rsquo;t forget that our awesome Communications Team has scheduled two more TED talk discussions! Details are below.

<h2 id="toc_664">Reminder: AR/TS: Read and Sign Acknowledgement of Updated Manual by 4:30 pm on February 1.</h2>

<p>As I shared in December, our draft manual update has become our new manual as of January 1. Because of this, we need everyone to read the manual and then  sign the acknowledgement page. The manual can be found at:<br>
<a href="https://blind.iowa.gov/manual">https://blind.iowa.gov/manual</a></p>

<p>Links to the acknowledgement page are in the table of contents of the manual. You have two options for signing the acknowledgement. You may print and sign the acknowledgement and then give  it to your supervisor   . Alternatively, we have received confirmation from DAS that we can use the below process for submitting the signatures electronically. I would encourage folks to use this method as it is more efficient:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign and date the acknowledgement sheet. electronically.</li>
<li>Email the acknowledgement  to your supervisor</li>
<li>The supervisor saves your email as a PDF.</li>
<li>The supervisor signs and saves  the document  as a PDF.</li>
<li>The supervisor sends the PDF of your email and the acknowledgement PDF to Janice for the personnel file.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any questions, please talk with your supervisor.</p>

<h2 id="toc_665">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Al:<br>
Congratulations to Ashley for getting through the braille code.  We have secured the apartments for  center students and will be moving students in as soon as possible.  Part of this we need your help for.  We need to secure pots and pans and other gently used kitchen stuff.  We have dishes and silverware, but we lack the cooking items.  This could also include microwave safe bowls or containers.  If you have any furniture that may be of use we would be happy to discuss it so please email Al if this is a possibility.<br>
As before, we would also like your stories of college.  More specifically, stories centered around challenges with blindness related problems and things that needed to be problem solved, or even if you never found a solution to the problem.  Please send these to Hanna G so that we can start compiling them to be used for college preparation.</p>

<h2 id="toc_666">Library Blog Updates Via Email</h2>

<p>From Sarah W.:F<br>
Library and Instructional Materials Center (IMC) Blogs<br>
The library has been working to develop two blogs to provide information and resources to its users.  The “Turning the Pages” library blog provides information on library services, programs and resources to its patrons and the public (<a href="https://iowalibrary.blog">https://iowalibrary.blog</a>).  The “Instructional Materials Center” blog provides information, programs and resources to educators, braille transcribers and others who work with students and accessible educational materials (<a href="https://idbimclibrary.blog">https://idbimclibrary.blog</a>).  We have a lot going on throughout the library and the staff continue to add amazing resources and content to these blogs.  To help IDB staff stay up to date on what the library and IMC provide, I will be adding IDB staff as subscribers to both blogs.  This means you will receive an email when a new blog post is posted instead of having to check the blogs for information.  The amount of emails you receive is minimal and we hope that this will give you a quick update on what the library is offering.  Anyone can subscribe to our blogs to receive these emails, so feel free to help us spread the word about these resources.</p>

<h2 id="toc_667">JAWS 2021 December Update is ready:</h2>

<p>From Wes: The JAWS 2021 December 2020 update is out. Essentially, the update was to come out in December, but unforeseen circumstances led to them delaying it until this week. This incremental update is packed with a number of items so the delay isn’t surprising:<br>
You can now adjust the system volume and the JAWS volume on the fly. This is handy for meetings where JAWS is being drowned out by the meeting audio. Hit JAWS Key+Space, V, then S for system volume or J for JAWS volume. Use the up or down arrow keys to adjust then hit “Escape” to save.<br>
You can now have the audio ducking feature that turns down other sounds when JAWS is speaking, along with the keep sound cards awake option checked simultaneously; this might help on some laptops and Bluetooth headsets.<br>
You can use the Windows 10 OCR engine in JAWS Convenient OCR to recognize text. The Windows 10 OCR is said to work better at recognizing onscreen text in controls and dialog boxes.<br>
Math equations written in Word’s Math Equation editor can be read by JAWS speech, and will appear in Nemeth Braille if a supported Braille display is attached.</p>

<p>To read the full announcement and feature description, visit: What&rsquo;s New in JAWS 2021 Screen Reading Software (freedomscientific.com)</p>

<p>IDB is authorized for JAWS’s current version. If you are running JAWS 2021, answer “Yes” to check for updates when JAWS starts to get the update. If you didn’t get that notification, we can help you troubleshoot this. In the meantime, click this link to install the update: \idbopac2\install\jaws\jaws 2021\J2021.2012.48.400-any.exe. You will need to be connected to VPN with a strong Internet connection.</p>

<p>If you’re still running an old version of JAWS, you are missing new features. You can click this link: \idbopac2\install\jaws\jaws 2021\J2021.2012.48.400-any.exe. You will need to be connected to VPN and have a strong Internet connection. If you install JAWS 2021 from another version, you will be walked through the process. When JAWS starts, you will be asked to migrate your user settings, Say “Yes” and choose your old JAWS version to have settings applied. Choose your startup options on the next screen.</p>

<p>IT staff are happy to answer questions to get you started or troubleshoot issues.</p>

<h2 id="toc_668">Director Update</h2>

<p>I got some feedback this week that the word &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; in the prioritization outline  could have been taken as hostile. This really wasn&rsquo;t my intent and I apologize if anyone took it as such. I am working very hard to be as pragmatic and non-judgemental as possible. . These are hard times that are hard on everyone and we will need to continue to give one another grace. I think we can all agree on that. I really appreciate thathe person who reached out to give me this feedback had the courage to do so. The way some folks feel abou public speaking is the way I feel about finding out I did something &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a huge shame trigger for me and my default response used to be to get defensive or even go on the offensive. This is unfortunately a common thing among the kind of folks who become bosses &ndash; so much so that we all assume that if someone is a manager they must be like this and get really nervous about pointing out a mistake they made. So I think it took a lot of courage to give me this feedback and I wanted to make sure to acknowledge that courage. </p>

<p>The Governor will deliver the Condition of the State Address at 6:00 pm on tuesday. It will be broadcast on her Facebook page and PBS and possibly other places. She also typically releases her budget at this time.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_680">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Cindy: to Wes.  I was working from home  and needed to research my new clients’ past case notes so I could prepare for their upcoming appointments when I couldn’t access Forticlient.  He had just returned from vacation and probably had a hundred emails to sort through, but he saw mine and  immediately addressed the issue.  That allowed me to properly prepare for my client appointments.  Thanks, Wes! </p>

<p>From Emily: I want to shout out Cheri, Jeremiah, and Jennifer K. for all their hard work during December. There are a number of federal reports that al come due at the end of the calendar year and we have some awesome but still new folks in that department. I know you all sometimes get overlooked as your work is less glamorous than the work with clients and patrons, but none of the cool things we do could be done if we didn&rsquo;t have you all paying the bills. Thank you for all the time and talent you&rsquo;ve been giving all of us during this busy season!</p>

<ul>
<li>Empty any unwanted beverages into a sink, fill up the cup with water and rinse the sink with it. Ice will melt :).</li>
<li>Put only empty cups and bottles in the trash.
Put all leftover food-related trash in a common large trash bin — every floor basement through 4th has two or more of them.</li>
<li>Drinking fountains and the ice machine are only made for accepting water—not pop, tea or coffee—anything but water stops them up.</li>
<li>If you eat in your office, at least weekly look around and clear it of open food or beverage containers.</li>

<h2 id="toc_684">Director Updates</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago,  I was notified that state government employees are being classified as essential workers under phase 1b of the vaccine distribution. I was asked to submit a count of our staff who met  their criteria for prioritization into three groups. While I had consultation and conversation with members of the leadership team about this, the final decision rested with me. So if anyone is upset by the decisions I made , please do not be upset with your supervisor. Putting this spreadsheet together was one of the toughest things I had to do this year. Honestly I want everyone to be eligible for the vaccine and receive it, but I needed to be honest and in line with the guidance provided by DHS and Polk County Public Health. Attached is the framework I used. From the information we were given, it seems somewhat to fairly likely that those in group 1 will be given the opportunity to be vaccinated. Folks in Group 2 may be able to if there is enough supply. I&rsquo;m attaching the info we received from Public Health regarding the vaccine. I am not choosing to require our agency staff to receive the vaccine, however, strongly encourage folks to be vaccinated if medically able to do so. It is a kind and helpful thing to do for yourself and all those around you. Logistical details are very sparse as there is much planning and a lot of unknowns around how much vaccine will be received and when it will arrive. At some point in the coming weeks, I expect to be notified that we are to send a list of names  and those people will be contacted and given instructions on where to go and when. We also shared how many staff we have domiciled in counties other than Polk and this information will be shared with county health in those counties. If anyone is absolutely not willing to be vaccinated or cannot be vaccinated for allergic reasons, please send me an email stating that you wish to be removed from the list. Please don&rsquo;t tell me why, just that you should be removed from the list.     If you have questions, I can do my best to answer them. We still have a long road ahead. The need for masks and hand washing and vigilance won&rsquo;t be going away any time soon, but things will get better.</p>

<p>2020 has been a hard year, but many good things have happened as well. Here is a brief list of some highlights and I know I will hav forgotten a lot of other great things so I&rsquo;m apologizing in advance :)</p>

<ul>
<li>We have brought on a number of great new staff. I&rsquo;ve already seen a lot of growth in these folks and am excited to see that growth continue in the coming years.</li>
<li>The library made the para-educator trainings we have been talking about for a long time a reality </li>
<li>The library kept books circulating when many other libraries across the country did not. </li>
<li>We got the 4+ program off the ground under challenging circumstances  and with a lot of hard work from the ETT team.</li>
<li>We continued our summer program and gave the youth the skills training and socialization they really needed with a lot of extra hard work and creativity from the ETT team and the summer staff.</li>
<li>We have acquired apartments for our center students because of the hard work of Al and Cheri. This is going to accelerate their independence and self-confidence.</li>
<li>We all learned a ton about remote training and meetings and this has made us more productive and efficient.</li>
<li>We all have made a commitment and substantial effort toward creating an agency based on truth rather than power. We have had some amazing conversations and put a lot of thought and heart into doing better and continuing to grow.</li>
<li>The Holiday Tea Committee raised $1200 for Toys for Tots and the Food Bank.</li>
<li>VR and IL field staff have embraced the challenges of serving clients and have worked very hard to help clients continue to move forward toward their goals.</li>

<h2 id="toc_685">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Al: We have been working with staff in training this week, but we have a couple favors to ask.  We are acquiring apartments for center students to live in while in training.  We are asking for gently used items such as furniture, pots and pans, etc. to put in the apartments.  Plates and silverware we already have, but other kitchen items as well as dressers couches, end tables etc. that you may have we would like to hear about.  Please let Al know what the item is through email.  We still need to measure the apartments so we know what the space can fit so we will not be taking items until we have that information.<br>
We are also gathering some scenarios for clients entering college.  If you were a blind college student and can remember a particular instance where you struggled or had to problem solve your way through a problem other than an equation we would like to hear about it.  If you can write something up and send it to Hanna that would be appreciated. <br>
The center would also like to send warm wishes for everyone at IDB in the coming year!!!</p>

<p>##Another Passing of Former Staff</p>

<p>Alan K. Ackley, 79, loving husband, father and grandfather, died unexpectedly at his home on December 24, 2020, in Des Moines, Iowa. Born July 2, 1941 in Des Moines, to Wayne and Karen Ackley, Alan attended Des Moines schools and graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School in 1959. He attended Drake University with Linda Lou Haney. The two married in September 1964.</p>

<p>Alan had an enthusiasm for mechanical things - especially Braille machines. It was when Alan began work at the Iowa Department for the Blind in 1974 that he found his calling. His orientation training (wearing sleep shades as blinders the first few weeks) triggered Alan&rsquo;s passion for Braille and his lifelong interest in Braille machines. Alan even became a National Library Service-certified Braille Transcriber. In the mid-70s, Alan started Ackley Appliance Service (aka Braillerman), his own Perkins Brailler repair company. At the time of his passing, Alan had reconditioned thousands of Braillers for individuals, schools, and agencies in nearly every state.</p>

<p>Alan is survived by his son Steven Ackley (Elizabeth), granddaughters Madison and Sabrina Ackley, brother James (Donna) Ackley, sister-in-law Carolyn (James) Shaffer, as well as beloved cousins, nieces, nephews, and many friends. He was preceded in death by his parents, Karen and Wayne Ackley, his wife Linda Lou Ackley, his brother R. Steven Ackley, and his son David Alan Ackley.</p>

<p>A memorial service will be coordinated at a future date to celebrate Alan&rsquo;s life. Memorial contributions may be made to National Federation for the Blind (NFB).</p>

<h2 id="toc_686">Update: Upcoming Communication Team All Agency Chat Discussion</h2>

<h2 id="toc_689">Update: AR/TS: Intro Videos Due by January 4th</h2>

<p>Thanks so much to all of you who have your videos in the folder. I know a lot of folks hate being on camera and I appreciate you all making this extra effort. For those folks still not having a video in the folder by Monday &frac14;, I&rsquo;ll be reaching out to see how we can assist you and help you make a plan for getting this done. As a Communications Team, we&rsquo;ve tried really hard to get folks to do it without making it mandatory, but the team has convinced me we need to make it a requirement and set a deadline to make this happen. So the instructions Tim put together, , the suggested prompts, and the instructions on what to do with the video are all below again for your reference. In addition, members of the communications  team will be reaching out to folks in their units to offer support and assistance. I know a lot of folks don&rsquo;t like being on video, but it is a really great tool to help us all get to know one another in these socially distant times. </p>

<h3 id="toc_691">How to use your Zoom Meeting as a simple video with audio recording device</h3>

<p>Launch your Zoom application (if you do not know how to do this, go ask your boss!)</p>

<p>Click on the &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; button (not the &ldquo;Join a Meeting&rdquo; button) and sign In using your email and zoom password</p>

<p>Based on your Zoom Settings, the new meeting may or may not be started with Video and Audio.<br>
Under &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Video&rdquo; if the option &ldquo;Turn off my video when joining a meeting&rdquo; is NOT Selected (i.e. not checked) then your Zoom meeting will start with your video camera  turned on. If it is checked, then the video camera will be started turned off! Also, under the &ldquo;Audio&rdquo; settings you may choose &ldquo;Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting&rdquo; (i.e. box is checked)</p>

<p>Click the &ldquo;New Meeting&rdquo; button to start a new Zoom meeting</p>

<p>Type &ldquo;Alt + V&rdquo; to start/stop video</p>

<p>An audio option dialog box pops up, click on &ldquo;Join with Computer Audio&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once the Zoom Meeting has started (and it is attended by one participant - you!) Alt + R will toggle on and off recording&hellip;</p>

<p>When you are ready to start your recording, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; - Do your presentation</p>

<p>When you are finished with your presentation, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; again to stop the recording</p>

<p>Type Alt + Q to end the meeting, and accept the default &ldquo;End Meeting for All&rdquo; (you will need to click on it)</p>

<p>When the Zoom meeting ends, a dialog box pops up saying that Zoom is converting the recording (it converts the meeting to playable audio only and video with audio files).</p>

<p>When finished converting, the folder where the converted audio and video files will pop up. <br>
By default, your video file will be named &ldquo;zoom<em>0.mp4&rdquo;. If you start and stop recording multiple times, the next video will be named &ldquo;zoom</em>1.mp4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;zoom<em>2.mp4&rdquo; etc. There will also be one (or more) &ldquo;audio</em>only.m4a&rdquo; file and &ldquo;playback.m3u&rdquo; files - you can ignore these files&hellip;</p>

<p>If you close the folder where the audio and video files are located and want to find it later, the default location is &ldquo;C:\Users&rdquo; + your username + &ldquo;\Documents\Zoom&rdquo; + the date/time stamp of the session + your name in Zoom + Zoom Meeting + your zoom meeting ID.</p>

<p>As an example, for a recent session I recorded, my folder is &ldquo;C:\Users\tim west\Documents\Zoom\2020-11-06 09.45.23 Tim West&rsquo;s Zoom Meeting 82602431448&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once you find the video you like and want to use I suggest you rename it!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it - congratulations, you&rsquo;re a video producer!</p>

<p>Here is a link to the folder. You may have to paste this into the address bar in Windows Explorer (to open Windows Explorer, hold down the windows key and press the letter e) You will need to be in the building or on VPN to connect to this folder just like any other H drive folder.</p>

<h2 id="toc_695">AR: Reminder Required Password Change</h2>

<p>Everyone should have seen the message from Craig Thursday. If you missed it: <br>
Due to security reasons all IDB Staff will need to reset their passwords. The system should require everyone to reset their password at  their next logon. Normal password syncing will occur with the encryption logon if you have a laptop.   If you don’t get the request to reset your password please change your own password at the earliest convenience.</p>

<h2 id="toc_696">Big Thanks For Donations</h2>

<p>Due to everyone&rsquo;s generosity at the basket auction, $856 was raised for the Food Bank of Iowa and Toys for Tots. In addition, the Holiday Tea Committee will be supplementing these donations with proceeds from the candy sales earlier this year to give $600 to each organization. That is a lot of kids who will have presents and families that will have enough to eat. A big thanks to  Dave, Sarah W., Darren, Angela, Leslie, Jodi, and Janice for all their hard work with the Holiday Tea Committee and helping us have a lot of fun, share our care for our colleagues, and help our fellow Iowans. Here is a clip that shows the need that I saw this week:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the past four months, the organization has averaged close to two million pounds of food per month distributed to hungry Iowans, hitting record levels three times this year— most recently in October when more than two million pounds of food were delivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The increase for Iowa households with children is even more sharp with the number of families in need tripling. Book said a recent food distribution event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds this month served 5,000 households and 60% of them never had sought food assistance before.&ldquo; (KGAN News)</p>

<h2 id="toc_697">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Thanks to everyone for all the great participation in the breakout rooms at All Staff Meeting.  I&rsquo;m attaching the notes I received so far. If you still have notes from your group, please do email them so they can be included. </p>

<p>A number of you hae probably seen some of the references to sexual misconduct related to structured discovery centers on social media. In order to create an environment that promotes client and staff safety, the leadership team is putting together a workgroup made up of direct service staff to work on making sure we are doing all we can. Supervisors of direct client service staff  are reaching out to their teams. A draft overview document is attached. There will be more info shared about the workgroup and what we have larned in coming weeks. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about All Agency Chat at 12:30 on Tuesday 12/22. Drew Joines is going to lead a discussion on the TED talk Cultural Diversity: The Sum of Our Parts by Hilda Mwangi. It is a little under 15 minutes long. We are asking folks to come to the discussion having already watched the video to allow for more time for people to talk. I&rsquo;ve watched the video and it really dovetails with our ongoing conversation. It also spoke to why making the intro videos is important. I think this will be a wonderful discussion and Drew has great ideas. </p>

<p>I wanted to get this out earlier to make sure folks are aware IDB has had 4 presentations accepted to this years conference. The conference will b held on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of next week.  I&rsquo;m really excited about the topics and the collaboration across divisions Unfortunately, 3 of our 4 presentations are in the same 12:30-1:30 time slot on Tuesday. The YATP presentation will be at 1:30 on Tuesday. We don&rsquo;t have links or the final agenda with all the breakout sessions yet, but here are the abstracts of our presentations:</p>

<h3 id="toc_709">Title: A Structured Discovery Approach toAccess Technology Training and Curriculum</h3>

<p>Lead Presenter: Enrique Mejia <a href="mailto:enrique.mejia@blind.state.ia.us">enrique.mejia@blind.state.ia.us</a>  (515) 443-3038<br>
Additional Presenters Amena Thomas, Joe Goode, Martha Harris</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>The only immutable law of technology is that it is always changing. How do we prepare our center and itinerant students to deal with that change? How do we keep them from coming back for more training every time an application is updated or a new device arrives on the market? <br>
Access Technology and cane travel have a lot in common. They both require applying general principles to new environments, practicing basic skills until they become second nature, and problem solving one’s way out of difficult situations. In our presentation, we will show how we apply these and other structured discovery techniques to the teaching of technology both within the center environment as well as in itinerant training. We will demonstrate how we go about writing curriculum and walk participants through our  open source curriculum project as an example. We will give tips on writing lessons that both explain the underlying concepts involved and encourage exploration and the use of problem solving skills through out each unit. </p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>Our agency’s philosophy of teaching braille is to start as young as possible and transcend through life while advocating, seeking resources, and connecting with others to teach braille, which directly effects the learning of children. Braille Babies for children 0-3 allows babies feeling braille, textiles, and textures while educating parents/care givers about the importance of braille. Books for Kids for children ages 4-18 teaches them to learn to read. Hooked on Books has activities such as word searches and games. Braille Bits is a braille program and podcast that reaches parents and para-educators to learn braille while educating them on the importance of braille in their children’s lives. Our Weekend retreats and LEAP program uses braille to show youth ages 14-21 that braille opens up worlds. Individuals can both learn braille and work toward a positive attitude about their blindness while forming strong bonds with their peers with our Braille Support Group in several locations around Iowa. The Orientation Center and VR teachers in the field teach using the Code Master curriculum which can be used at any age and takes the fear out of learning braille by breaking it down in a faster, easier way to understand.</p>

<p>Abstract: </p>

<p>One of the perennial challenges for a training center is how to keep new graduates from going home and returning to old patterns. At the Iowa Department for the blind, we are working on a new model to help students keep the level of motivation and activity they develop while in the center going to propel them into their future. We want the student to be excited about what comes next and prepared to do the work it takes to make their dreams a reality. We want the student and vocational  rehabilitation counselor to be on the same page and working together to support that dream. Our Jobs Class instructor and one of our new center graduates will share the what, when, why, and how of the post-center plan  and the Life Skills and Jobs class pieces that lead up to its creation. </p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>When blind students graduate high school, they should be prepared to move on to the next stage of their lives with the same opportunities and challenges as their sighted peers. If this is not the case, they should possess the basic skills needed to enter an adult training center. Unfortunately, this is not the reality for many blind youth. These  students, whether due to additional barriers, lack of skills training, and/or low expectations, are either stuck at home or entering  programs designed to allow extra time for the completion of IEP goals. Unfortunately, most of these programs lack the expertise to serve blind youth, and blind youth in these programs end up even further behind when they age out of the education system.<br>
The Iowa Department for the Blind has created the Young Adult Transition Program (YATP) to serve as an alternative. This program, modeled on our structured discovery training center, gives youth   the opportunity to learn the alternative techniques of blindness, build self-confidence and self-efficacy, and come to understand that blindness will not stop them from achieving their fullest potential. Come learn about opportunities and challenges in building this program and discuss strategies for more effectively serving these students.</p>

<h2 id="toc_712">Holiday Gift</h2>

<p>Starting Friday, there will be a box of bath fizzies in the east elevator lobby. Please help yourself.  The hearts are cinnamon and the round ones are pepermint eucalyptus lavendar. I make these as a hobby and try to do this each year.  For those folks out of town, I&rsquo;ll keep a box in the front office so that folks can pick one up next time they are in town. Usually it works out that folks are in for the all staff, but it&rsquo;s 2020 :) so Some did not shape the best and I had the wrong size of shrink wrap. But I hope you or someone you&rsquo;d like to share one with  can enjoy a little relaxation and peace this holiday season. It&rsquo;s a small token of the large appreciation I have for each of you and the work that you do.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_713">Fun Fact</h2>

<p>The Braille Bits podcast has 2400 downloads in the last 90 days . Great job Denise and a big thanks to those who have come on the podcast and shared their stories.</p>

<h2 id="toc_714">Congratulations to liz!</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to send good wishes at All Staff, but wanted to make sure to share out that Liz will be retiring on January 7th after 14 years of service to blind Iowans. In total, Liz has worked for the State 14 years from 2003 to 2007 then from 2010 thru Jan 2021. We honor her work and are grateful for her contributions. Here is what was shared in the Commission Board report by Kim:</p>

<p>Liz has been well respected by clients because of her commitment to deliver quality and timely services. She has also garnered respect from division colleagues as she delivers services with passion every day and has developed close friendships. Liz’s commitment to excellence is one that I have come to depend on. <br>
As her supervisor, I personally owe her a debt of gratitude for her unconditional dedication to those she serves. She will be missed, but we can only feel happy for her after her many years of service at the Iowa Department for the Blind. Thank you so very much Liz and we wish you much success as you start this new chapter of your life.</p>

<h2 id="toc_715">Former IDB Employee Passes</h2>

<p>From Commisioner Ryan: Debra Peek was a secretary in Field Operations for 19.5 years, I think in the 80s and 90s? She became my secretary in 2000 or 2001 at the Iowa Department of Public Health, and continued to work there for several years after I retired.</p>

<h2 id="toc_716">Baby Shower</h2>

<h2 id="toc_718">Resources: MENTAL HEALTH FOR VISITORS AND LOVED ONES:</h2>

<p>From Kathy: If there is an unknown person   in or around the building who appears to be having a crisis, please call Facilities Engineer Randy Walford or if he is not available, another member of the Facilities Team  to handle the situation. If you feel an immediate need to call 911 due to immediate danger, please tell the dispatcher anything that you notice which could be related to mental or physical health, as they can determine whether to call the Mental Health Crisis Team or an ambulance. Below is a tip card that can help any of us anywhere when we see someone in Crisis Who has a Psychiatric Illness.</p>

<h3 id="toc_719">Nami Greater Des Moines Pocket Card Do’s and Don’ts tips for Communicating with Someone in Crisis Who has a Psychiatric Illness:</h3>

<p>Do :</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow down.</li>
<li>Give them space. Don’t make them feel Trapped</li>
<li>Be Calm. Express support and concern.</li>
<li>Use short, simple sentences.</li>
<li>Avoid sudden or quick movements.</li>
<li>Be Helpful. Respond to basic needs. Be low key. “We are all here to help.”</li>
<li>Give firm, clear directions&ndash; One person should talk to the subject.</li>
<li>Respond to delusions or hallucinations by talking about the person’s feelings rather than what he or she is saying.</li>
<li>Listen to their story.</li>
<li>Explain policy, especially if handcuffed.</li>
</ul>

<p>DON’T:<br>
* Take Control if you don’t have to.<br>
* Argue or reason with psychotic thinking.<br>
* Stare at the subject.<br>
* Confuse the subject.<br>
- One person should interact with the subject<br>
- Others should keep their distance.<br>
- Ask casual observers to leave.<br>
* Follow through with directions or commands.<br>
* Touch the subject unless necessary – for people with mental illnesses it may cause fear and lead to violence.<br>
* Shout.<br>
* Give them multiple choices – this can increase the subject’s confusion<br>
* Whisper, joke or laugh<br>
* Deceive the subject. Dishonesty increases fear and suspicion: the subject will likely remember it in any subsequent contact.<br>
* Don’t arrest a person for mentally ill behavior not criminal in nature.<br>
* Join into behavior related to the person’s mental illness<br>
* If the person has to be restrained, don’t hogtie. Immediately raise him/her from prone into sitting position, monitor vital signs and call for medical aid.</p>

<p>Next, here is another NAMI card we can likely all use at some point this holiday and Covid-19 season, the NAMI Greater Des Moines Compassionate Communication Card:</p>

<p>Front of Card:</p>

<p>You are not alone. The illness is not your fault. Never Give up hope.<br>
Executive Director: 515-850-1467 or 27700672, <a href="mailto:Director@namigdm.org">Director@namigdm.org</a><br>
511 E. 6th St., Suite B, Des Moines, IA 50309</p>

<p>Back of Card Do’s:</p>

<p>Guard Your Temper<br>
* No nagging, yelling, arguing<br>
* Focus on the person you know and love<br>
* Provide reassurance generously and often<br>
_______examples ___________<br>
“I love you, and I care.”<br>
“You’re not alone in this.”<br>
“I’m sorry you’re in so much pain.”<br>
“I’m always willing to listen.”<br>
“I’ll be your friend no matter what.”<br>
“This will pass and we can ride it out together.”<br>
“You are important to me.”<br>
“When this is all over, I’ll still be here.”</p>

<h2 id="toc_720">Reminder: AR/TS: Intro Videos Due by January 4th</h2>

<p>So in our Communications Team meeting on Thursday, we discussed how to get folks  to do the intro videos. We&rsquo;ve tried really hard to get folks to do it without making it mandatory, but the team has convinced me we need to make it a requirement and set a deadline to make this happen. So the instructions Tim put together, , the suggested prompts, and the instructions on what to do with the video are all below again for your reference. In addition, members of the communications  team will be reaching out to folks in their units to offer support and assistance. I know a lot of folks don&rsquo;t like being on video, but it is a really great tool to help us all get to know one another in these socially distant times. </p>

<h3 id="toc_722">How to use your Zoom Meeting as a simple video with audio recording device</h3>

<p>Launch your Zoom application (if you do not know how to do this, go ask your boss!)</p>

<p>Click on the &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; button (not the &ldquo;Join a Meeting&rdquo; button) and sign In using your email and zoom password</p>

<p>Based on your Zoom Settings, the new meeting may or may not be started with Video and Audio.<br>
Under &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Video&rdquo; if the option &ldquo;Turn off my video when joining a meeting&rdquo; is NOT Selected (i.e. not checked) then your Zoom meeting will start with your video camera  turned on. If it is checked, then the video camera will be started turned off! Also, under the &ldquo;Audio&rdquo; settings you may choose &ldquo;Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting&rdquo; (i.e. box is checked)</p>

<p>Click the &ldquo;New Meeting&rdquo; button to start a new Zoom meeting</p>

<p>Type &ldquo;Alt + V&rdquo; to start/stop video</p>

<p>An audio option dialog box pops up, click on &ldquo;Join with Computer Audio&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once the Zoom Meeting has started (and it is attended by one participant - you!) Alt + R will toggle on and off recording&hellip;</p>

<p>When you are ready to start your recording, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; - Do your presentation</p>

<p>When you are finished with your presentation, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; again to stop the recording</p>

<p>Type Alt + Q to end the meeting, and accept the default &ldquo;End Meeting for All&rdquo; (you will need to click on it)</p>

<p>When the Zoom meeting ends, a dialog box pops up saying that Zoom is converting the recording (it converts the meeting to playable audio only and video with audio files).</p>

<p>When finished converting, the folder where the converted audio and video files will pop up. <br>
By default, your video file will be named &ldquo;zoom<em>0.mp4&rdquo;. If you start and stop recording multiple times, the next video will be named &ldquo;zoom</em>1.mp4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;zoom<em>2.mp4&rdquo; etc. There will also be one (or more) &ldquo;audio</em>only.m4a&rdquo; file and &ldquo;playback.m3u&rdquo; files - you can ignore these files&hellip;</p>

<p>If you close the folder where the audio and video files are located and want to find it later, the default location is &ldquo;C:\Users&rdquo; + your username + &ldquo;\Documents\Zoom&rdquo; + the date/time stamp of the session + your name in Zoom + Zoom Meeting + your zoom meeting ID.</p>

<p>As an example, for a recent session I recorded, my folder is &ldquo;C:\Users\tim west\Documents\Zoom\2020-11-06 09.45.23 Tim West&rsquo;s Zoom Meeting 82602431448&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once you find the video you like and want to use I suggest you rename it!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it - congratulations, you&rsquo;re a video producer!</p>

<p>Here is a link to the folder. You may have to paste this into the address bar in Windows Explorer (to open Windows Explorer, hold down the windows key and press the letter e) You will need to be in the building or on VPN to connect to this folder just like any other H drive folder.</p>

<h2 id="toc_723">Update: Upcoming Communication Team All Agency Chat Discussions</h2>

<p>To support and expand our 200% Accountability Project, the Communications Team is hosting a series of discussions. The first one will be on December 23rd at 12:30.  Drew Joines is going to lead a discussion on the TED talk Cultural Diversity: The Sum of Our Parts by Hilda Mwangi. It is a little under 15 minutes long. We are asking folks to come to the discussion having already watched the video to allow for more time for people to talk. I&rsquo;ve watched the video and it really dovetails with our ongoing conversation. It also spoke to why making the intro videos is important. I think this will be a wonderful discussion and Drew has great ideas. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tv7NaV47no">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tv7NaV47no</a></p>

<p>On January 12,, Tim West will be leading another  discussion on a TED talk by Brene Brown. called The power of vulnerability. This is one of my all time favorite TED talks. I was going to say it is definitely worth watching the video even if you can&rsquo;t attend, but if you are able, I know Tim is going to make this great talk into a great discussion.  </p>

<p>Shout Out</p>

<p>From Joe W.: I’d like to give a shout out to Hanna Geisinger. She has really helped my client Jessie make the move from Cedar Rapids to Des Moines. During Jessie’s training time in the OC, Jesse worked really hard and she decided she would have more opportunities if she moved to DSM. Hanna has helped her find housing, sorting through all the Section 8 housing regulations. She encouraged Jesse to explore resources such as Gifts and Bequests and worked with her on how to secure movers. This was a very big step for Jessie and the assistance and support from Hanna really helped Jesse take this big step forward.. Another great example of the dedicated staff we have here at the IDB. Thank you so much, Hanna!</p>

<p>1.What stuck out to you most when watching this webinar? 2. Any new insights about the previous webinar or previous conversations that you found after watching this section? 3. How would you answer the poll questions that were presented: “Have you had a conversation about racial or gender bias in the workplace? Was it successful”? 4. If you haven’t had a conversation about bias, why not? 5. After watching this video, have you discovered anything you have been on autopilot about? 6. Brooks mentioned that he always asks the question: “What are the things we are pretending not to notice?” How would you answer that question? 7. The statement was made that diversity is just numbers but inclusivity and equity means that each person is just as likely to be successful while being themselves. What does that mean to you? 9. Brooks said that he also always asks the question: “ what would the world be like if we stopped trying to convince anyone of anything?” How would you answer this? In what situations do you think this would be easier? ? Are there situations when you would struggle with this? 10. what are you going to do differently after reflecting and having this conversation? 11.</p>

New Braille Device in the Library</p>

<p>The library was able to purchase a Mantis with quota funds and it has arrived. Here is some info Karen C. shared:</p>

<p>The price was $1,995 in quota funds, but is $2,495 if not using quota funds.</p>

<p>Here is a brief description: The Mantis is a first of its kind braille device providing an all in one solution for users who want to keep braille at their fingertips while utilizing a Bluetooth QWERTY keyboard. A user no longer needs to carry both a Bluetooth keyboard and braille device, along with their computer / mobile tool, or choose between choosing braille or not if they are using a QWERTY keyboard. The Mantis is small enough to fit easily in one’s laptop or tablet bag and has the internal intelligence to be a powerful tool in a classroom or job environment.</p>

<p>Sharing Sad News</p>

<p>Two of our IL Team folks have lost parents recently. Here is William “Bill” Shipley’s obit. This is Alyssa’s father:</p>

<p>Center Updates</p>

<p>Check out the very end of this email for a picture and description of Pam’s n industrial arts project.</p>

<p>From al: Richard completed his final meal, lead a business class, and had an informational interview. Josh and Troy completed a drop off, Sara had an informational interview, and Jessie completed her move to Des Moines. The zoom business class was ok for hearing people except for those students in the far reaches of the room. We will continue to work on this and will perhaps be offering zoom business classes more often.</p>

<p>Director Updates</p>

<p>We had a productive Commission Board meeting on Tuesday via Zoom. The Commissioners passed the policy updates, so we will be able to roll out the new manual on January 1. We talked about the updates to the work rules and disciplinary procedures back at the June all staff meeting. There shouldn’t be too much else included in this update that would be considered much of a change. I think it is a fair bit better organized and less redundant. This is work in progress. Additional procedures will be added for reference as they are written up or changed as needed. Please let me know if you have any questions. You can find the new manual at:</p>

<p><a href="https://blind.iowa.gov/manual">https://blind.iowa.gov/manual</a></p>

<p>I have had to cancel the 2nd Tuesday All Agency Chat Questions &amp; Ideas this month due to conflicts with the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind conference that is going on online this week. There is no word from the Governor’s office related to our budget yet, but we will be sending an update to the legislature regarding our COVID response this week.</p>

<p>Resource: Highway Helper Program</p>

<p>Shared by Hannah N., copied from the DOT website</p>

<p>The Highway Helper program provides incident response and free assistance to stranded motorists on the roadways in the Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Cedar Rapids/Iowa City and Quad Cities metros. The focus of the Highway Helper program is to provide travelers and emergency responders with a safe and efficient transportation system. The Highway Helper services can quickly address the needs of stranded motorists by providing; jump starts, tire changes, up to two gallons of fuel, and transportation to a safe location. In addition, each truck is equipped to provide traffic control and quick clearance for emergency responders.</p>

<p>Highway Helper trucks patrol the freeway and interstate systems and are dispatched to other Iowa DOT roadways in Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Cedar Rapids/Iowa City, and Quad Cities metro areas from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday through Friday; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays in Des Moines; and some holidays and special events. In addition to patrolling the area, the Iowa DOT Traffic Management Center uses traffic cameras to monitor roadways, and dispatches Highway Helper trucks to needed locations.</p>

<p>The public can request assistance from the Highway Helper by calling 911.</p>

<p>IL Update</p>

<p>From Kim: Our IL Division has been invited by Department of Human Services to help explore how they can maintain the integrity of their dependent adult abuse and mandatory reporting curriculum and provide for modality which would be considerate, user-friendly and accessible for those with disabilities. Both Kelsi Hansen and I will be participating in this focus discussion.</p>

<p>“Individual commitment to a group effort – that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.” – Vince Lombardi</p>

<h2 id="toc_729">Joke of the Week</h2>

<p>It’s really easy to tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile.</p>

<p>One will see you later and the other will see you after a while.</p>

<h1 id="toc_730">November 24, 2020</h1>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t intended to send out another Coffee Talk before the holiday break, but there were definitely enough updates and things to share. I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and have fun and relaxation. over the long weekend. </p>

<h2 id="toc_731">AR: Rules Reminder</h2>

<p>As it says in our return to work rules:</p>

<p>5  May take off masks while eating lunch. Lunches or snacks may be eaten in one’s work area, in 2nd floor South, on the rooftop deck, or in the basement break area. While eating staff will maintain a six foot distance from others. After eating, each person will clean their eating area. Cleaning solution will be available in 2 South and in the basement break room. Staff should bring wipes to clean their area after eating when choosing to eat lunch on the roof.</p>

<p>Please do not eat in an office with  another person or multiple people. Please do not eat in conference rooms. This is a simple step we can all take to reduce the possibility of COVID spreading through our agency.   I know this has been a long haul. Folks want to be able to celebrate and socialize. But   COVID numbers ar very high here in Des Moines and throughout the state. They are predicted to increase after the holidays. COVID doesn&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s your birthday or your favorite holiday. I cannot express enough how much we need to take our COVID precautions seriously and think about how we could be exposing others if we are carrying the virus and not knowing it. Please consider   the health and safety of your colleagues and their loved ones. Please remember that if we have an outbreak, this would result in  Richard, Katie, and Jesse not being able to finish up and graduate the center in December. Please remember that failing to follow our guidelines and rules  risks  YaTP not being  able to finish the semester in person and puts our ability to deliver all of our services at risk. We need to remember that our work is very important to those we serve and take reasonable precautions and use common sense to keep all of our services going. There are a lot of people who need us, let&rsquo;s please not let them or our colleagues down. </p>

<p>From Al: Richard completed his final grad walk, Joy completed a drop off, Katie had her final meal, and Sara had a small meal. </p>

<h2 id="toc_735">Intro Videos</h2>

<p>A really easy way to record your video is using Zoom. you can start a meeting in your personal meeting room with just you, hit record, start talking, end the meeting, and grab the mp4 file from off your hard drive, plop it in the H drive folder, and you&rsquo;re done :) Here are some additional instructions Tim West graciously compiled to help you out with this:</p>

<h3 id="toc_736">How to use your Zoom Meeting as a simple video with audio recording device</h3>

<p>Launch your Zoom application (if you do not know how to do this, go ask your boss!)</p>

<p>Click on the &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; button (not the &ldquo;Join a Meeting&rdquo; button) and sign In using your email and zoom password</p>

<p>Based on your Zoom Settings, the new meeting may or may not be started with Video and Audio.<br>
Under &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Video&rdquo; if the option &ldquo;Turn off my video when joining a meeting&rdquo; is NOT Selected (i.e. not checked) then your Zoom meeting will start with your video camera  turned on. If it is checked, then the video camera will be started turned off! Also, under the &ldquo;Audio&rdquo; settings you may choose &ldquo;Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting&rdquo; (i.e. box is checked)</p>

<p>Click the &ldquo;New Meeting&rdquo; button to start a new Zoom meeting</p>

<p>Type &ldquo;Alt + V&rdquo; to start/stop video</p>

<p>An audio option dialog box pops up, click on &ldquo;Join with Computer Audio&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once the Zoom Meeting has started (and it is attended by one participany - you!) Alt + R will toggle on and off recording&hellip;</p>

<p>When you are ready to start your recording, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; - Do your presentation</p>

<p>When you are finished with your presentation, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; again to stop the recording</p>

<p>Type Alt + Q to end the meeting, and accept the default &ldquo;End Meeting for All&rdquo; (you will need to click on it)</p>

<p>When the Zoom meeting ends, a dialog box pops up saying that Zoom is converting the recording (it converts the meeting to playable audio only and video with audio files).</p>

<p>When finished converting, the folder where the converted audio and video files will pop up. <br>
By default, your video file will be named &ldquo;zoom<em>0.mp4&rdquo;. If you start and stop recording multiple times, the next video will be named &ldquo;zoom</em>1.mp4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;zoom<em>2.mp4&rdquo; etc. There will also be one (or more) &ldquo;audio</em>only.m4a&rdquo; file and &ldquo;playback.m3u&rdquo; files - you can ignore these files&hellip;</p>

<p>If you close the folder where the audio and video files are located and want to find it later, the default location is &ldquo;C:\Users&rdquo; + your username + &ldquo;\Documents\Zoom&rdquo; + the date/time stamp of the session + your name in Zoom + Zoom Meeting + your zoom meeting ID.</p>

<p>As an example, for a recent session I recorded, my folder is &ldquo;C:\Users\timwest\Documents\Zoom\2020-11-06 09.45.23 Tim West&rsquo;s Zoom Meeting 82602431448&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once you find the video you like and want to use I suggest you rename it!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it - congratulations, you&rsquo;re a video producer!</p>

<p>Here is a link to the folder. You may have to paste this into the address bar in Windows Explorer (to open Windows Explorer, hold down the windows key and press the letter e) You will need to be in the building or on VPN to connect to this folder just like any other H drive folder.</p>

<h2 id="toc_742">Great Stats and Success Story</h2>

<p>From Ashley W.: This past quarter, VR partnered with 10 clients to successfully achieve their career goal. These 10 clients are working an average of 39 hours per week and making an average of $22.19 per hour; demonstrating quality over quantity. These statistics show our dedication to not only assist individuals in obtaining employment that align with their skills and interests, but also our focus on the importance of sustainable employment and financial security, which is always essential, but is crucial now more than ever, during these uncertain times. I have worked with VR counselors to gather success stories that highlight what we do as an agency and the services we provide that assist individuals to reach their career goals. As the upcoming holiday season approaches, I think it is important to take some time to reflect on the good and realize we can all be thankful for each other and the services we provide. </p>

<p>Rachel partnered with her client M.S. to successfully achieve her career goal as a full-time Director with Mississippi Valley Workforce, earning $70,000 annually, in addition to working part-time as an Adjunct Professor for Upper Iowa University, earning an additional $12,600 a year. This client demonstrates how services can work to assist in achieving one&rsquo;s career goal, in addition to working up for the position you want within an agency. The client worked with her counselor to develop her plan and made her plan work for her.  Rachel stated that &ldquo;M.S. was always the one to drive her plan and never relied on me to tell her how or what to do.  M.S. is driven and ambitious and asks for what she needs and wants.&rdquo;  Client M.S. started as the Board secretary, assisting with coordination of Board meetings and as the two regions began to merge given direction at the state level, the client took initiative and figured out how to do that. M.S. went from putting in 10 hours per week as a secretary to applying for and getting hired as the Board Director within 4 years.  M.S. goes after what she wants and IDB has been a support, but only minimally and always guided by the client. This client was provided with tuition assistance for her degree in Public Administration, as she was completing her degree she was also working as a secretary, while also managing her own business. IDB also provided the client with technology services; Rachel, the client, and Joe G. worked together to determine what technology would work best for her in employment, as the client gained additional hours and responsibilities within Workforce. M.S. was then provided with a Focus 40 Braille Display. She uses a braille display to take notes during meetings and advocates to her employer and coworkers to ensure things are in electronic format. M.S. uses her cane independently and arranges her own transportation. These are all skills that client M.S. gained from IDB over the years that enabled her to achieve her career goal and maintain financial independence. </p>

<h2 id="toc_747">Upcoming Holidays</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be a grinch, but just a reminder to please remember that state law does not allow supervisors to receive gifts valued above $2.99 from employees. I know that we have super awesome caring staff at IDB who love giving gifts.  This is really great, but please if you do want to give a gift to your supervisor, please, please  keep it under this limit. While bigger gifts are very generous and come from the best of intentions, they do also put the manager in a really awkward situation when they need to give it back or find it a new home. Thanks for understanding.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_748">Director Updates</h2>

<p>I hope everyone has a safe and very happy Thanksgiving. It is my favorite holiday. And while I&rsquo;m not getting to spend it the way I usually would, which is the case for most of us this year,   I have so much to be thankful for. ONe of those things is that I get to have a truly amazing job where I get to work with some of the smartest, moste talented, most dedicated folks I&rsquo;ve ever known. Thank you so much for all that you do to make IDB a great place to work and to empower  blind Iowans. </p>

<p>Friday morning Sarah W. and I had a meeting with the Department of Education to discuss issues related to a braille production vendor and share a solution that will hopefully lead to significant improvements in the quality and timeliness of materials received as well as eliminating costly and wasteful  duplication of effort. I really appreciate the knowledge and passion of our IMC team and all the effort they have been putting into documenting and mitigating the vendor issues and coming up with a solution that would make braile better for kids and save the taxpayers of iowa money. I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people recognize the level of knowledge and skill that trained transcribers possess and how important it is to have management in place who knows that the customer is the student and the student deserves to have the same quality of materials and high expectations as their sighted classmates.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve received a couple of questions this week I&rsquo;d like to make sure everyone knows the answer to. The All Agency Chat Philosophy Discussions are for IDB staff, they are a chance to discuss blindness philosophy and are held at lunch time to try to give another time option in addition to regular or morning business class. It is held from 12:0-1:30 on the fourth Tuesday of each month.  The Director&rsquo;s Forum is open to all and primarily targeted to folks outside our agency. It is an opportunity to get updates and ask me questions about things going on at IDB. This is held at noon on the third Friday of the month. If you have success stories to share in Coffee Talk, you can email them directly to me. Also please do take a minute to email me shout outs when your colleagues do something above and beyond. </p>

<p>reminder: The topic for the All Agency Chat Philosophy discussion on 11/24 at 12:30-1:30  will be  &ldquo;Carrying a cane versus using a Cane&ndash;What&rsquo;s the Difference&rdquo; Some questions we&rsquo;ll explore include: Why the long cane?

<h2 id="toc_749">Intro Videos</h2>

<p>A really easy way to record your video is using Zoom. you can start a meeting in your personal meeting room with just you, hit record, start talking, end the meeting, and grab the mp4 file from off your hard drive, plop it in the H drive folder, and you&rsquo;re done :) Here are some additional instructions Tim West graciously compiled to help you out with this:</p>

<h3 id="toc_750">How to use your Zoom Meeting as a simple video with audio recording device</h3>

<p>Launch your Zoom application (if you do not know how to do this, go ask your boss!)</p>

<p>Click on the &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; button (not the &ldquo;Join a Meeting&rdquo; button) and sign In using your email and zoom password</p>

<p>Based on your Zoom Settings, the new meeting may or may not be started with Video and Audio.<br>
Under &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Video&rdquo; if the option &ldquo;Turn off my video when joining a meeting&rdquo; is NOT Selected (i.e. not checked) then your Zoom meeting will start with your video camera  turned on. If it is checked, then the video camera will be started turned off! Also, under the &ldquo;Audio&rdquo; settings you may choose &ldquo;Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting&rdquo; (i.e. box is checked)</p>

<p>Click the &ldquo;New Meeting&rdquo; button to start a new Zoom meeting</p>

<p>Type &ldquo;Alt + V&rdquo; to start/stop video</p>

<p>An audio option dialog box pops up, click on &ldquo;Join with Computer Audio&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once the Zoom Meeting has started (and it is attended by one participany - you!) Alt + R will toggle on and off recording&hellip;</p>

<p>When you are ready to start your recording, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; - Do your presentation</p>

<p>When you are finished with your presentation, type &ldquo;Alt + R&rdquo; again to stop the recording</p>

<p>Type Alt + Q to end the meeting, and accept the default &ldquo;End Meeting for All&rdquo; (you will need to click on it)</p>

<p>When the Zoom meeting ends, a dialog box pops up saying that Zoom is converting the recording (it converts the meeting to playable audio only and video with audio files).</p>

<p>When finished converting, the folder where the converted audio and video files will pop up. <br>
By default, your video file will be named &ldquo;zoom<em>0.mp4&rdquo;. If you start and stop recording multiple times, the next video will be named &ldquo;zoom</em>1.mp4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;zoom<em>2.mp4&rdquo; etc. There will also be one (or more) &ldquo;audio</em>only.m4a&rdquo; file and &ldquo;playback.m3u&rdquo; files - you can ignore these files&hellip;</p>

<p>If you close the folder where the audio and video files are located and want to find it later, the default location is &ldquo;C:\Users&rdquo; + your username + &ldquo;\Documents\Zoom&rdquo; + the date/time stamp of the session + your name in Zoom + Zoom Meeting + your zoom meeting ID.</p>

<p>As an example, for a recent session I recorded, my folder is &ldquo;C:\Users\timwest\Documents\Zoom\2020-11-06 09.45.23 Tim West&rsquo;s Zoom Meeting 82602431448&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once you find the video you like and want to use I suggest you rename it!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it - congratulations, you&rsquo;re a video producer!</p>

<p>Here is a link to the folder. You may have to paste this into the address bar in Windows Explorer (to open Windows Explorer, hold down the windows key and press the letter e) You will need to be in the building or on VPN to connect to this folder just like any other H drive folder.</p>

<h2 id="toc_754">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Sarah B.: Thank you to all the staff that have helped out by participating in informational interviews with the YATP program clients. I have noticed that each student has improved in their confidence, communication skills, and thought process as they are aware of all the different career paths at the department. Each student has participate in interviewing three employees  at the department, five people outside the department who are blind in a variety of fields, and finally two people who are in a similar career that they are interested in. I have also enjoyed learning so much about each employee’s path to the department and appreciate our various background and experiences that lead us to all work together.</p>

<h2 id="toc_755">TechSpresso: The Iron Mug and Baby Shark Edition</h2>

<p>From Wes: As more staff are migrating to Mobile Iron, the centralized Mobile Device Management software that we are rolling out across the agency, I wanted to say a few words about it. The system gives us the flexibility to push updates, manage app distribution to phones, and remotely manage other aspects of devices. It can assist us in unlocking phones if you forget your password.</p>

<p>We can push messages to specific phones; some of you may have seen this already. These messages are either emails, push notifications (popups on the lock screen or banners), or both. You will periodically see messages from “The Mobile Iron Team”. These are either auto-generated notifications such as if your passwords expire, or they are messages we have written and sent. We will do our best to use the subject conventions that agency emails use, such as AR:, TS:, or FYI:. This will let you know that we created the message. We will also accompany the email with a push notification that summarizes the email; the push notification has very limited space. You might ask, “Why not just send messages through email?” We may do this on occasion, but sending phone-specific messages through Mobile iron’s control panel lets us target specific phones that might need attention, such as for out of date software, or other concerns.</p>

<p>Mobile Iron also lets us manage phones that have been lost or misplaced by wiping data, locating the device, and playing a sound. This is a reminder to report phones that you cannot find as soon as you can to aid in locating or deleting the data for permanently-lost devices. This is especially true if the phone was turned on as the battery will only power the phone for limited time even on standby.</p>

<p>JAWS for Windows 2021 has been released as of yesterday. Anyone running 2020 will see a notification that the 2021 update is available, or you can get to this through Help &gt; Check for Updates. This ability to update to main versions through JAWS Updates is a big new feature. Another major highlight is a voice assistant for controlling features of JAWS vocally. The complete run-down is at: <a href="https://support.freedomscientific.com/downloads/JAWS/JAWSWhatsNew">https://support.freedomscientific.com/downloads/JAWS/JAWSWhatsNew</a> The agency is authorized for this new version so you can install it if you wish.</p>

<h2 id="toc_756">Center Update</h2>

<p>At the bottom of this email, there is a picture of our new custodian Phil with his picture frame he made in shop class. </p>

<p>From Al: Jessie completed her final meal on Friday.  She had meatloaf, baked potatoes, vegetables, and blond brownies.  Richard and Jessie have both completed their post center plan, an Katie will be completing her final meal and post center plan next week. Joy and Sara both also had informational interviews.</p>

<h2 id="toc_757">Director Updates</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m presuming everyone saw the email from the Governor thanking everyone for their hard work and announcing that the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Christmass Eve will be paid holidays this year. This is great and much appreciated! But please remember that this will make it extra important to have time sheets done early. Stay tuned for updates from your supervisor on when they will need those in. </p>

<p>The topic for the All Agency Chat Philosophy discussion on 11/24 at 12:30-1:30  will be  &ldquo;Carrying a cane versus using a Cane&ndash;What&rsquo;s the Difference&rdquo; Some questions we&rsquo;ll explore include: Why the long cane? How do you counsel someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to use a cane?

<h2 id="toc_763">Shout Out</h2>

<p>From Cindy: I enjoy getting emails from Janice.  She always takes a minute to comment on the weather or ask how you are doing and wish you a good day.  She also makes a note to follow up on even the smallest detail.  I can’t imagine how many emails she receives in a day and those extra 10-20 seconds she spends on each individual one could really add up.  She could use that time to take a well-deserved break or cross another thing off her long “to do” list, but she chooses to take a moment to show her appreciation and brighten your day.  Thanks, Janice!  You’re my favorite name to see in my in-box! J</p>

<h2 id="toc_764">Important COVID Exposure Reporting Reminder</h2>

<p>I very much appreciate how well folks have been doing with mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing. Taking this seriously not only helps our colleagues and families stay healthy, but it keeps us from being short handed and reduces interruption to client services. Below are excerpts from DAS guidance for agencies. I believe folks are doing a really good job of communicating with their supervisors, but this may help clear up points of confusion. This has been a bit of a moving target in terms of defining close contact and other terms, but doctors are starting to have better data on how spreading occurs and these definitions are beginning to stabilize. Cases are rising in Iowa and the upcoming holidays are expected to create additional spikes. Vigilance and good communication will be key to keeping services going and our colleagues as safe as possible. If you have questions, please contact me or your supervisor. Thanks for taking the time to read this carefully and communicating with your supervisor.</p>

<ul>
<li>We encourage all state employees who test positive or feel they have a known COVID-19 exposure to contact their supervisor and call their healthcare provider.</li>
<li>If an employee tests positive for COVID-19 and other people were potentially exposed in the workplace (the positive person was less than 6 feet away from other people for more than 15 minutes), the employing agency should call the Iowa Department of Public Health (Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology 24/7 call line is 800-362-2736). IDPH will assess workplace exposures (make 14-day quarantine recommendations) and advise on control measures.</li>
<li>Positive cases should isolate at home away from other people and animals until at least 3 days have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.</li>
<li>Close contacts of a positive case should call their healthcare provider if they become sick and let them know they have been exposed to a case of COVID-19. Close contacts can also consider getting tested for COVID-19 but should ideally wait at least 2 days after their exposure to the case. It should also be noted that even if a close contact tests negative, they still need to quarantine for 14 days in case they are still incubating the virus and become sick later.</li>
<li>All State agencies are asked to complete the COVID-19 Agency Report Form if an employee may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. (This is completed by Janice once the report is made to the supervisor.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact your supervisor if you have been exposed or suspect you have COVID-19. </p>

<h2 id="toc_765">Sending Positive Thoughts</h2>

<p>From Kim: Alyssa has shared that Wednesday her father was transported to the Council Bluffs hospital to the ICU where he tested positive with COVID19. He has other added complications including pneumonia. Alyssa shared that they  are providing some aggressive treatments to help stabilize him. Asking that our IDB family send Alyssa and her family well wishes for positive thoughts and a speedy recovery. </p>

<h2 id="toc_766">Online Application for Library Services Now Available</h2>

<p>The library has launched an online application form that can be used by individuals to apply for library services.  The information needed to complete an application has not changed, except when using the online application form a certifying authority signature is not required.  What is required is complete contact information for the individual acting as the certifying authority (name, title, address, phone and email).<br>
Remember, it is important whether the individual is using the online or print application to apply for services that all the information is provided.<br>

Going forward please send any applications for Gifts and Bequests to Jeremiah’s attention.  The next Commissioners meeting is fast approaching so please get any applications for Gifts and Bequests sent in so they can be processed for the Commission’s approval.</p>

<p>Please also send anything to Jeremiah that you would have sent to Joyce.  This will help me to train him on all of the responsibilities that Joyce had.</p>

From Al: Joy completed a meal on Friday, and Phil and Jeremiah completed their picture frames. <br>
We are going to be experimenting with some audio options for business classes in 2 South so that if they work, people will be able to join by Zoom.  This may not be every day but perhaps once a week.</p>

<h2 id="toc_769">BEP Modernization Update:</h2>

<p>From Kathy: IDB soon will be a model of modern vending and this will continue statewide to most the locations blind vendors in BEP operate! IDB has purchased $700k of new vending machines to replace machines that are older than the concept of cashless payment. This rollout has had the inevitable glitches that any new software and hardware may have, so you may have seen BEP Staff, vendor Abe Sigler and others from the credit card company working in the IDB vending area to figure out those glitches that have been frustrating for vendors and customers like you! Thanks in advance for your grace and patience until it is awesome, and continuing to check in!</p>

<p>WHY BEP: This month BEP Elected Committee Members are stepping up to coach a newer vendor with tips and tricks that have made them successful. This benefit of community is something BEP vendors get that the average start-up business owner has to work hard to find!</p>

<h2 id="toc_770">Updates on IDB Vending machines</h2>

<p>For folks coming in the building, Abe (our vender) shared the following updates. Please pass this info along to visitors and students as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>all machines now can take  credit cards</li>
<li>PayRange now works on all but the coffee  machine</li>
<li>You can also pay with Google Pay or Apple Pay.</li>

<h2 id="toc_772">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Next week is semi-annual CSAVR conference, so unfortunately I&rsquo;m going to have to cancel the all agency chat &ndash; ideas and questions regularly scheduled for the 2nd Tuesday of the month.  I&rsquo;m looking to revamp this to more of a virtual lunch and learn where different teams from across the agency share out about what they are doing. I&rsquo;m looking for volunteers to share in December. if you are on a team doing something cool the rest of the agency should know about, please let me know and we&rsquo;ll get you scheduled. </p>

<p>I presented on IDB programs and services at the annual NFB of Iowa state convention this past Saturday. I was very Happy to share all the ways that folks have innovated and pivoted in these challenging times. We have way more going on than  could fit into 30 minutes and I apologize if I left out something or someone &ndash; especially all the new staff. I was happy to share that although there were only 7 VR closures for the past quarter (PY20&ndash;Q1) they averaged more than $19.00 per hour and averaged 40 hours per week. So while it wasn&rsquo;t the quantity we would like, it was definitely the quality and In light of  the huge disruptions in the hospitality and transportation industries (among others) the quanity looks a lot better. While some VR counselors and teachers across the country and some public employees might see the pandemic as an excuse to take it easy or provide less service, I so very much appreciate you all recognizing how important the work you do is and finding ways to get clients and patrons what they need as safely as possible. </p>

<p>Folks may or may not have heard about the proposed resolution that was not passed by NFBI. I am in the process of writing a letter to the presidents of both organizations that they may choose to share with their leadership or membership as they see fit. I want to reaffirm our commitment to informed choice, our support for our center and our  dedication to working with both consumer organizations to improve client outcomes. I&rsquo;ll also share this in Coffee Talk.</p>

<p>Ann Fremont shared this with me and tells me that the training for epileptic seizures is free, so I thought it might be worth sharing in coffee talk for staff to consider and pass along to loved ones! She took the class and says that certification is good for two years.</p>

<p>November is Epilepsy Awareness month and there are 5 online classes offered this month.</p>

<p>Please Bring Newspapers and Paper Flyers For YATP by November 3rd</p>

<p>From sarah B.:YATP is planning on making papier-mâché piñatas for a fall festival activity. If anyone has old newspaper or paper fliers that they can donate please drop them off in the box across from Sarah B’s office on the window ledge on 3rd floor or in 2 south on top of the piano on the west wall in the NW corner. Please drop them off by Tuesday November 3rd by 8am as we plan to make them that morning. Right now we have only half of what we need. YATP thanks you for your assistance and supporting the students in their fall festival.</p>

<p>Center Updates</p>

<p>From Al: Karly completed her 5 year continueing education in the center, Sara had an informational interview on Thursday, and Joy had a dropoff on Friday. Jeremiah and Ashley both finished their shop projects this week as well.</p>

<p>Technology Update</p>

<p>From Helen: Effective November 4 Wes will be relocating to the Lincoln Nebraska area to join his wife Allison who was offered a new job at the Nebraska Recycling Council. Wes will continue to work in his current position from Lincoln, and will come to DSM one week per month. Wes will still be available for remote tech support, such as password resets, and screen reader issues. This will hopefully correspond with him having more uninterrupted time to make needed updates to our case management system.</p>

<p>Director Update</p>

<p>I wanted to just take a quick minute to thank everyone for their participation in the accountability discussion on Monday. I felt like we had great conversation and could have kept going much longer. I’m attaching the notes from the groups who sent them in. If you have notes you haven’t sent in yet, it’s not too late. For our December all staff, we all need to be sure to have watched the second webinar. You can find this at:</p>

<p>We hope to have discussion question updates to you in the next couple of weeks so folks can be thinking about them.<br>
The leadership team agreed this week that we will need to hold the December all-staff meeting virtually. This makes us sad as the in-person Holiday Tea is a real treat and highlight, but it’s just not a great idea to bring that many folks into the same room right now and there’s no evidence to suggest that it will be any better in December. However, the Holiday Tea Committee is busy figuring out ways to bring us all some cheer and we will find more ways to add fun and joy to the week.</p>

<p>Shout Out</p>

<p>From Sharonda: I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Amena Thomas, who worked with me, using great and creative ideas, to correct a mishap that had taken place. While I was stressing out big time, she had creative ideas and solutions to get the job done. I absolutely loved the teamwork and intercommunication that took place. In a culture where teamwork is encouraged, not just on among the members our own teams, but also across teams, I was thankful to be a part of this synergy. And the good news is? We got everything routed to the client in record time, and all turned out well!</p>

<p>AR: If you reserve DAS Fleet</p>

<p>Please reserve midsize cars or small SUVs from DAS fleet. There have been issues with the smaller cars we have been getting reacting badly to E85 fuel and DAS is working to remove this requirement, but for the time being, please reserve mid-sized and small SUVS. Thanks.</p>

<p>Center Updates</p>

<p>From Al: Richard completed a delicious meal last Friday, and this week he and Jessie both completed drop offs. Sara’s first small meal will be completed today and I’m sure it will be delicious as well. Joy finished the code and is on to her first article which is on the longer side, consisting of 60 pages, double spaced and single sided, but still a little longer than maybe the norm. Be sure to ask her if she can give you one of the 29 reasons to visit Iceland. Jennifer Brown is now out of the center and on to performing her job on the ETT. We will get the links out to watch the videos for both Jessie and for Richard after they completed their drop offs.</p>

<p>BEP &amp; Facilities Updates</p>

<p>From Kathy: Welcome back John Wallace from leave—BEP is learning, serving and planning to build on the program together so Roxy, John, Sara and I are a cohesive team. He has spent Thursday out in the field helping a vendor prepare for 17 degree temperatures coming too quickly. Thanks to Randy Walford for getting out there also and fixing a water pipe!</p>

<p>Welcome to Phil Tharp, who started Friday, October 23, and who will work overnight once he graduates from the Orientation Center, which he begins Monday, October 26. He comes with both an accounting background and several years of custodial work in schools (he likes things clean!). Phil will give the custodial realm some time to work without interrupting others and without being interrupted—a win-win!</p>

<p>Reminder: Please update your computer</p>

<p>From Craig: We need everyone to update their ESET virus protection on their machines. It needs to be version 7.3 or higher. To check, go to start, ESET, ESET Endpoint Security, Help &amp; Support, and towards the bottom is the version. Using JAWS, you can tab through the window to find “Help and Support” and activate it. It will then read out the information; you can also use JAWS cursor to read it more slowly. If it is less than 7.3 then go to the “H” drive, ESET 2020 folder, and double click the file there. A box will pop up, select “Run”, “Next”, check the bullet point to “I Accept the Terms in The license Agreement”, “Next”, make sure the “Enable” bullet is selected(It should be), click on “Install”, it will run for a little while and then click on “Finish”. Your machine will need to be restarted as soon as possible and ESET will ask to “Restart Now”.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help. If you have any issues please call me.</p>

<p>Today I attended the quarterly state workforce board meeting. Iowa Workforce Development (IWD) Director Beth Townsend reported that Iowa currently has 64,000 available jobs and a 65% labor force participation rate. We also passed another set of WIOA required policies that were developed by our core partner working group. A big thanks to Keri for her work on this project.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to our continued conversation on Monday. See below for the connection information. I’m also looking forward to our all agency chat philosophy discussion at 12:30 on Tuesday. I’m attaching again the speech we will be discussing. I’m looking for feedback and ideas about what to do with the 2nd Tuesday ideas and questions all agency chat slot. Here are a couple of ideas that have come up, Feel free to add others.</p>

<p>Share outs from a different team each month about projects or programs they are working on.<br>
Keeping it an ideas and questions time, but sending out a list of questions or topics folks are looking for feedback on ahead of time.<br>
We received info this week on the 2020 Dare to Be Remarkable Conference that will be held in mid December. We are hoping to submit presentations for the conference. Students and clients can attend for free and participate in a VR client track and we will definitely want to encourage all clients that are interested to participate. More information will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Reminder: AR: Follow Up Accountability Discussion 10/26 11:00-12:30</p>

<p>Hello all, as promised, we are going to continue the great discussions we were having at All-Staff Meeting regarding the 200% Accountability Webinar. Some folks have already watched the second webinar, that’s great, but the expectation is only that you have watched the first one by this meeting and have watched both before December all-staff meeting. I’m including the link again below</p>

<p>Because we were low on time, we will be picking back up with the questions from last round. We’ll also be mixing up groups to let folks bounce thoughts and ideas off of new sets of colleagues. This also lets us all get to know more folks we maybe don’t get much of an opportunity to talk with in other areas of the agency.</p>

<p>We are also including a number of scenarios for groups to discuss after the group feels they have worked through the questions. We can continue to work through these scenarios in December and beyond. Several of these scenarios come from actual experiences of staff in recent years. If folks have ideas for more scenarios to include, please email them to me.</p>

<p>We will meet all together in the Zoom briefly and then be whisked away to our breakout sessions for the majority of our time. Then we will return for some short share outs at the end. We had some great conversation last time and I am looking forward to building on this. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>Small Group Discussion Questions:</p>

<p>What was your biggest take away from the webinar? As they say in the webinar, each organization needs to decide how to apply these principles to their structure and operations. What does 200% accountability look like for IDB? How do we know we are making progress? How are truth and accountability currently reflected in our values and actions? What can we do to be more in alignment with our values? What are we currently doing well in terms of accountability? What strengths do we already have that will help us get better? Where are their opportunities to improve? What resources would help us to take advantage of these opportunities? What could be done today that isn’t being done now?</p>

<p>Scenarios:</p>

<p>1.what words would you use to address a client who stated “I’d like a new counselor, someone who is not “Hispanic, Asian, Catholic, Gay, etc.” 2. how and when would you address a colleague who said, “ugh, I hate dealing with people on SSI ” or “Old clients just can’t deal with technology.” or “Kids are the worst” 3. How would you respond to a colleague who said to you “my manager is so bi-polar! Yesterday she was in a great mood and today it’s like the world fell over”? 4. You work in the library and are answering the main library phone. A patron wants help with BARD and you say that you will have Jodi give her a call as soon as she can. The patron says they would prefer a man call them as men are better with technology. How do you respond? 5. You are a VR Teacher working in the field. Your client tells you they want a different VR Counselor. You ask why and they say they don’t&#39; feel comfortable with their counselor and want a counselor like them. The counselor is black and the client is white. What do you say? 6. You are a VR counselor, your client wants a different VR teacher because a blind person can’t keep them safe while they are learning cane travel. What do you say or do? 7. You are eating lunch in 2S and overhear two center students talking . One of the students tells a racist joke. The other center student laughs and the conversation continues. What do you do? Does your answer change if one of the participants was a staff member? What if it was two staff members? what about if it were two supervisors?</p>

<h2 id="toc_787">Director Updates</h2>

<p>A big thanks to Matt, Leland, Drew, Hannah, Joe G., and Ross for letting me crash the last day of announcements at SELF week. I really enjoyed hearing about the progress these VR clients had made in just a week of intense training. I could tell it had made a huge difference in these clients confidence. Now is  a great time to start encouraging VR clients you work with to sign up for the March SELF week. </p>

<p>There were some rumors going around regarding the All Agency chat attendance. Just to clarify, attending the 4th Tuesday philosophy discussions each count as one business class for the purpose of staff continuing education requirements. This month&rsquo;s topic will be consumer organizations, their relationships to agencies for the blind like ours and their benefits to those we serve. The article I&rsquo;d like folks to have read before the chat is attached. Some folks may remember it from new staff seminar. I also like to re-read this article before speaking to the consumer groups at their state conventions. I&rsquo;ll be presenting at the NFBI convention on October 31. Some folks may remember Brianna Gowen (now Bri Berquam)  &ndash; former IL and VR teacher out of Pella. She moved to Wyoming a couple of years back and is now President of the NFB of Wyoming. Their convention was  Saturday  and I talked  about alternative techniques for wood working. It was the only presentation I ever got to give wearing a flannel shirt. She put together a really great agenda and   hopefully recordings will be online sometime soon.  </p>

<p>In order to help build some new service synergies, Craig has moved from the Education and Training division to the Library division. This really won&rsquo;t make any practical difference in terms of tech support processes, but we wanted to share this info in case anyone wondered why Craig is now  attending Library team meetings. The Library has a good portion of our technology and is hoping to expand their systems to improve educational material delivery to blind youth across the state in the coming months. </p>

<p>We have not yet been asked to present or update on our SFY22 budget request. We&rsquo;ll be very excited to do this when the opportunity arises. </p>

<h1 id="toc_796">October 2, 2020</h1>

<h2 id="toc_797">Success Stories</h2>

<p>From Lisa: I just finished a meeting with a client and wanted to share this for coffee talk.  </p>

<p>My client lives in Clinton and her Dad works in the office at a manufacturing plant where they make plastic parts.  This client has a sister who is also blind that has worked in the plant part-time while going to community college and worked full-time during the summers.  My client has completed a bachelor’s degree and wanted to work at the plant in for a year while she was applying to get into graduate school.  Even though her sister and her Dad both work at the plant the plant manager did not want to hire her because she has less sight than her sister and he wasn’t sure she could do the job.  After some conversations and my client demonstrating she could do the job she was hired in June to run a machine at the plant.  Just last week the manager came up to her and told her that he wanted to apologize because he was totally wrong in thinking that she couldn’t do the job.  He congratulated her on going above and beyond to prove that she can do the job just as well as anyone else!

<h2 id="toc_798">Intro Videos</h2>

<p>The Communications Team would like to remind you to please send in your intro videos. They do not need to be fancy, just a minute of you so that your colleagues can put a face and a voice to your name in these days of disconnection. I know it is stressful and a lot of folks get self-conscious and nervous being reorded on video. but it will be really helpful to new people and all of us wanting to get to know our colleagues better. </p>

<p>Since I had technical difficulties trying to get the videos to play through the intranet, I&rsquo;ve moved them to the H drive. You can find them under Common2020. Tech staff has been working to clean up the H drive to make sure we have enough space and clear out the clutter of very old and unused items. Common 2020 is where we are putting new shared items to help with this process. If it is more convenient to drop the video file in this folder directly, please feel free.<br><br>
Here is a link to the folder. You may have to paste this into the address bar in Windows Explorer (to open Windows Explorer, hold down the windows key and press the letter e) You will need to be in the building or on VPN to connect to this folder just like any other H drive folder.</p>

<h2 id="toc_799">Continuing the Conversation</h2>

<p>I wanted to share some correspondence Leland and I had this week about the newspaper articles shared last week. This is patched together from the first message he sent and some additional info he shared after I asked if it would be OK to share this in Coffee Talk.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reminders of my past interviews with people about my blindness… You are 100% right no matter how well you interview and purposely avoid and shoot them down about saying it’s inspiring the article will come back sounding more like 40% what it should be and 60% about how amazing you are and how people should try and take inspiration from your story. Sure it’s a read that will leave most with a sense of warm fuzzies but leaves me with a chunk of ice in my stomach. </p>

<p>At the same time I can be honestly pleased seeing that Joe’s clients are activily doing something not everyone is doing. It is great but so are the rest of their peers who are doing it. That’s the part that makes me upset is how they gloss over the other people sitting there putting in as much and in some cases more effort and they are ignored cause there is a blind person. If only we could fix the media.<br>
Anyways there is my 10 minute rant for the day. Make it a great one!!!</p>

<p>Feel free to throw it into next coffee talk if you like! I feel like it was worded well enough not to give the wrong impression. I could add more to it and expand but I do like keeping things brief.  I only want to make sure you feel like it gives the sense I do think Joe’s clients are doing great things cause I honestly do and I love the fact he shared with everyone. This is probably one of the trickiest subjects to talk about as depending on where you are coming from something can be genuinely inspiring despite being blind. After all I know the idea of doing something even if you don’t quite know how to manage because of your blindness is hard. The big part of if it’s inspiring to me is was this something brand new to the person or have been doing it for a while. Cause throwing yourself into something new is inspiring to me no matter who you are but after that it becomes someone’s normal. I feel like this why this subject is so tricky. I could go on for days so I’ll stop here!</p>

<h2 id="toc_803">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From the center: Richard had his second small meal on Wednesday.  HE cooked BBQ wings, potato salad, baked beans and chocolate mousse.  Enrique had all the students sign up for the e-readers and reports the following.  As students start to receive their eReaders from the library, they are all starting to realize how useful they will be at helping them practice their braille in everyday life. By sending texts, emails, and just browsing Facebook and other useful and not so useful tasks. It is great to see students realize that braille is a very important component to being able to use technology effectively.<br><br>

<p>##Update on Mobile Device Management</p>

<p>From Helen: We are excited to have 25 people switched over to our new software. Thank you to everyone who has participated so far. Thank you in particular to everyone who promptly scheduled your appointment with Wes and have given us feedback. I know it has already improved some processes for people. As expected, there have been some hiccups along the way. Some of these issues our software vendor is working on, for example, allowing the Apple software updates we want to go through, some are us getting the right instructions in the software to do exactly what we want, such as making sure you have the notifications you need while still meeting confidentiality guidelines, and some are because half of our staff are still on the same Apple ID and the other half are moved over.<br>
If you send someone a text message and they don’t get it, or someone sends you one and you don’t get it, try starting a new conversation instead of continuing a text message thread. Conversations don’t always just use your phone number, and so when half of us changed off the Apple ID, message threads appear to have lost track of where to find some people. Starting a new conversation threat appears to fix this because then it starts back with just the phone number.<br>
When issues arise, please make sure you let Wes know about them. This will help you because we might already have a solution, and this will help us find out about issues so we can work to solve them.<br>
For those of you who have not made the leap forward yet, I will be reaching out to you at some point to schedule your appointment with Wes. Please pay close attention to the instructions in the email. In particular, it is essential that you make sure your contacts are syncing correctly with Outlook. If you recognize contacts are not syncing before we make the switch, we have a system for transferring them. If we don’t know about it until afterward, they are already gone. We put a brief pause on adding more people while we track down some of these issues, so if you received an email from me but did not schedule yet with Wes, please wait. I anticipate we will resume again the week after next, and I will reach out to everyone when we are ready for you to schedule your appointment.</p>

<h2 id="toc_817">Stories About Clients</h2>

<p>From Emily: I need to put a little preface on the below items as I believe they deal with one of the hardest philosophical quandaries we face currently. I want to start off by saying that I am extremely happy for the young people talked about below. All of us want them to be successful and happy and enjoying sport like everyone else. We are all very happy for them and wishing nothing but the best for them. What I&rsquo;m going to say below should not in any way be taken  as anything negative toward the youth or their families. This is about the coverage and language and framing of what they are doing and the challenges with  that framing. </p>

<p>Those of you who have been in New Staff Seminar in the last few cycles have seen this video, but I want to put the link here to reference what I&rsquo;m talking about when I talk about &ldquo;inspiration porn&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d ask you to watch this TED Talk before reading onward if you haven&rsquo;t seen it already. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K9Gg164Bsw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K9Gg164Bsw</a></p>

<p>Sometimes there can be a thin line between positive awareness building and inspiration porn. There are times it will go back and forth in the same article. Sometimes no matter how many times you tell a reporter &ldquo;This is just a normal thing, blind people can do whatever other people do, we just do it differently.&rdquo; they just can&rsquo;t stop saying we are amazing or playing up that angle to get more clicks.  Many of us who have been in this field for a long time will have known folks ( andSome of us will have experienced it. ourselves) who have been hurt by being told how amazing they are, how well they maxi maize their vision, and how doing things visually is the only or primary way to do things. . As someone who has been working for the past 25 years to deal with the consequences of growing up being told how amazing I was for doing the same things my peers were doing and also how well I maximized my vision and how  I did so well you wouldn&rsquo;t know I was blind, I feel deep concern. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in being unable to calculate the therapy bills, tears, and missed opportunities that growing up with that view of my blindness has cost me.  I&rsquo;m not sharing this to make this about me or to say my view is the right or only view.  I am sharing this so that anyone   who doesn&rsquo;t  understand why many of us cringe and worry when reading things like the below can have a sense of why. I am hoping that we all can  have really great crucial conversations about these issues in the coming months. </p>

<p>From Joe: While meeting with Eastside counselors-recently, we were sharing cool stories about some of our clients and I wanted to share two stories with you in hopes that you could have these as part of your next Coffee Talk.  They are great reminders of the awesome people we work with and it truly shows the grit and determination of these two young people, in particular.  Bailey Martin is a client of mine and James Peterson works with Jamie Phipps.</p>

<p>Bailey is training for the 2024 Paralympics and recently traveled to Spain with other athletes and the United States Association of Blind Athletes and met International soccer superstar,  Leo Messi.  Below is an article and video clip link on Bailey from the USABA Facebook Page.</p>

<p>Bailey Martin is an 18-year-old high school student from Hubbard, Iowa. She is also a promising blind athlete, currently training for the 2024 Paralympics. Bailey lost her vision only a few years ago and is now considered legally blind. She was diagnosed with the rare eye disease Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy at the age of twelve. It began when one morning, she couldn&rsquo;t see out of her left eye. A few months later, she started losing her central vision as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVqiJLEv6Hc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVqiJLEv6Hc</a></p>

<p>James Peterson is a Senior at Center Point Urbana High School and he is also the starting center on their football team.  James was recently feature on KCRG news.  Below is the article and video link on James.</p>

<p>James Peterson<br>
CENTER POINT, Iowa (KCRG) - Never put limitations on your children. If they believe they can do something they will find a way to get it done, no matter what kind of odds they face.<br>
Center Point Urbana Senior James Peterson is legally blind but that doesn’t stop him from playing the game he loves.<br>
James is the starting center for the Center Point Urbana Stormin Pointers.<br>
“My parents felt very strongly about not telling me I couldn’t do things because they believed I could do it no matter what,” James said.<br>
“He doesn’t look at his disability as a disability,&ldquo; CPU offensive line coach Kevin McCauley said. &quot;He acts like he’s a normal high school student, and he’s out here to play. If you didn’t know he had a visual disability he wouldn’t know that when you watch the game.”<br>
James was diagnosed with Stargardt disease when he was in the third grade.<br>
“It’s a disease in the back of the retina actually,” James said. “It affects the macula. If I was standing 20 feet away from something and you were standing 400-500 feet away from it, you would be able to see that thing with as much clarity as I could from only 20 feet away.”<br>
James said his central vision is actually worse than his peripheral vision, so he looks through the side of his eyes. But James has never used his lack of sight as an excuse on the football field or the classroom, where is ranked number one in his class with a perfect 4.0 GPA.<br>
“I use a lot of different tools to help me out in school to see the things that I need to,” James said. “With things on the board, teachers can share their screens with me. It allows me to see what they are reading on the board. I also have a device that magnifies papers, so I can see what the paper says and write on it.”<br>
It’s that high level of intelligence that also helps James on the football field.<br>
It really helps that he’s smart because he knows every play to the “T,” coach McCauley said. “He knows exactly where to go regardless what defense comes out there, or if they shift at the last minute, he still knows what he supposed to do. He is just so disciplined and mechanical, it’s pretty amazing what he can do. His vision impairment doesn’t even seem like it’s an impairment on the field.”<br>
Basically they just show me where I need to go and that’s where I go,&rdquo; James said. “When we do scout, they’ll show a play card, and I’ll just have the guy to my right or left tell me what I’m supposed to do and I will just do it.”<br>
You would think safety would be a concern for James and his coaches, but it’s not.<br>
“He has worked hard in the off-season, he’s always in the weight room regularly,” coach McCauley said. “And so we are really not concerned for her safety, because I think he makes up for it with his preparation and his intelligence of the game.”<br>
James is a true inspiration to everyone around him.<br>
“He is an inspiration, not just with kids with disabilities, but all of us,” CPU Head Coach Dan Burke said. “If we have anything that we’re kind of feeling sorry for ourselves about certain things or whatever, look at James, he’s overcome all these things, and he never complains. He’s always in a good mood. He is a role model to us all.”<br>

<h2 id="toc_824">Shout Outs</h2>

<p>From Lisa: I have to give another shout out.  This one is for Joe Goode.  I have several clients who are working or in school that needed devices this fall and Joe has taken care of them as quickly and efficiently as possible.  He also made the time in his schedule to pick up a loaner computer that needed to be retrieved in order to close a case.  This morning I asked Joe if we could get a device purchased for a client within the next week or two and his answer, right away!  With everything Joe has going and being pulled in every direction he is always pleasant and does all that he can to make things happen for clients.  I cannot tell you how his response made me smile on this Monday morning!</p>

<h2 id="toc_825">Cubicles are offices too :)</h2>

<p>Just a reminder, please don&rsquo;t go into someone&rsquo;s workspace when they are not there without their permission. Sometimes folks think because it is a cubicle and there&rsquo;s no door, you can just step in and grab an office supply or something you need, but this is no different than getting into an office with a door without permission. Thanks for  respecting everyone&rsquo;s space and things.</p>

<h2 id="toc_826">Email Subject Line Codes</h2>

<p>Not to be adding more to the many acronyms and pieces of jargon we all swim in, but I&rsquo;d like to explain the common email subject line prefixes we have been using and add a couple more :)</p>

<ul>
<li>AR Action Required &ndash; there is something in this message you need to do something about.</li>
<li>COT: Consider or Toss: you might find this useful, or you might not </li>
<li>EOM: End of Message &ndash; this is a way of sending someone a quick note in the subject line of an email and letting them know the body of the email is empty. It&rsquo;s a text, but in your email. </li>
<li> FYI:  For Your Information &ndash; no action is required, but there is information you need to know.</li>
<li>Q: Question &ndash; you have a question you are posing that folks should answer if they have an answer or leave if they don&rsquo;t (Example: &quot;Q: anyone available to cover this meeting? Fwd: Consortium Council of Iowa meeting 9/16&rdquo;)</li>
<li>TS: Time Sensitive &ndash; there is a deadline or other reason this email loses its value if it sits for a certain period of time. Letting the recipient know the time frame in the subject is very helpful. ((for example: &ldquo;AR/TS: report needed by noon 9/16&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed myself that if an email doesn&rsquo;t tell me what it is wanting from me in the subject or first two sentences, it is much more likely to get buried under other tasks. If you have other email ettiquette tips to share, please send them along!</p>

<h2 id="toc_827">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From the center:  Jen met the challenge of making puff pastry from scratch this week.  Although her first attempt failed miserably, and she laughed at me as I tried to convince her she could save it, she persisted, and the day after went really well.  The students spent some time thinking about fund raising during covid and how that can be done.  It appears that we may have the ability to order shirts or possibly sweat shirts with our new IDB logo on them before the end of the year.  The other idea was a dropoff challenge or competition similar to how Emily and I did one for the food bank to raise money and prove that dropoffs are not to be feared, but embraced as sport.</p>

<p>##Staff Intro Videos<br>
 I&rsquo;ve put them in a folder, but I&rsquo;m having trouble getting them to play from links from the web browser. If any HTML whizs out there can tell me what I&rsquo;m doing wrong how to make it work, that would be great. But for now, if you copy the following path into the address bar in Windows Explorer (press windows key + e followed by alt+d and then paste in the below) and you can see the four videos we&rsquo;ve collected so far. These are great and keep them coming!</p>

 Thanks again to everyone for your great work this morning. I&rsquo;m attaching the notes I&rsquo;ve gotten so far. If you still have notes to send, please send when you have a chance.</p>

<h2 id="toc_833">AR: Getting into Compliance for Notifications on Your Computer</h2>

<p>From Wes: To comply with the IDB policy manual, it is important not to have personally identifiable information not be visible/audible on your lock screen or when using your computer. One big source of this information is email in Office 2016. Windows 10 has something it calls Toast notifications because it is a banner that pops up from the bottom of the screen like a slice of toast from a toaster. We can hide that banner for an app while still letting the chime come through:<br>
Invoke the settings menu by pressing windows key (the one with the four squares on it)+I, or click “Start” then the gear icon.<br>
Once settings opens up, choose “System” ( JAWS users will need to tab out of the search, arrow through the list and hit Enter).<br>
In the next list, choose “Notifications and Actions”, again, screen reader users will have to tab out of the search box and into the list before arrowing to a selection.<br>
On the next screen, you will need to navigate down to the point where it says “Receive notifications from these senders”; you can tab to this or use the touch cursor.<br>
Each app in this list has two entries, one to customize notification settings, the second to turn off notifications for that app automatically.<br>
If you want to retain the sounds and see the notifications in the action center, choose the button with the title of the app, in this case, Outlook 2016.<br>
Once this opens, find the checkbox that says “display notification banners” and deactivate it.<br>
Activating Home closes the window and saves the settings.<br>
Now Outlook makes sounds, but does not display the message banner. You can see the notifications in your Action Center by pressing Windows+A.</p>

<p>For those on Mobile Iron, we have turned off lock screen notifications by configuration; we are still allowing the banners for now, but this may change. </p>

<h2 id="toc_835">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Why is it the short weeks always feel the busiest? :)  Below is the info for the video we will discuss on Friday if folks have not yet watched it. I&rsquo;ll be sending out a handout and the questions for our small group discussion soon. While it would be great to be able to have all of us together in person next week, I&rsquo;m still looking forward to seeing everyone virtually. It will be a busy week with the ILAC meeting and VR teamFest and divisional meetings, etc.</p>

<p>I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about telework. The one thing that drives and defines what services we provide and how we provide them is &ldquo;What will allow us to serve our clients and patrons most effectively?&rdquo; While times are still challenging, we are adjusting and need to ensure that we are following that main guiding principle in all our processes, procedures, plans, and programs. This is just as true for teleworking as it is for any other aspect of what we do. If a person can serve clients as well or better working from an alternate location, then  telework is an option. However, if a staff person&rsquo;s teleworking arrangement results in less service, lower quality service, or more work being placed on colleagues, it is not going to be an option. It is a supervisor&rsquo;s job to ensure that their work units maximize their potential in serving clients and patrons and determining whether teleworking is working is a part of this.</p>

<h3 id="toc_836">: Required Viewing for All Staff Meeting on Friday, September 18th</h3>

<p>we are asking all staff to have watched this webinar and taken the time to think about it before we discuss on September 18th. While we have made a lot of improvements in our communication and culture in recent years, we want to truly become an organization based on truth rather than an organization based on power. Managers will be following up and more information will be shared in coming weeks, but we wanted to give folks as much lead time as possible to make sure everyone had time to think about the webinar after watching it. For this discussion, we will be focusing in on the first session about 200% Accountability. This is the one you are required to watch for this meeting. The second webinar is very good also and we will hopefully focus on this one at a later time. Here is the link:</p>

<h2 id="toc_839">First Aid app for Android update.</h2>

<p>After using the First Aid app on an Android phone over the weekend, I found out that it is in fact accessible. I used most of the tabs, and read through several of the descriptions including playing the videos, and I found that it worked well.</p>

<p>NOTE: The downside to Android devices is that this may not hold true for every Android phone. In some phones TalkBack, which is the Android Screen reader may behave completely differently and so the app may or may not be accessible. I tried this app using a Google Pixel 3 running Android 10.0.</p>

<h2 id="toc_840">Reminder: One Minute Intro Videos</h2>

We are hoping to link these videos to each person&rsquo;s entry on our staff listing page. If you would prefer not to have your video there, we can share it with staff internally via the intranet. We have put together a list of questions that folks could use as prompts if you wish. If you would like to record your own video, please keep it about one minute and email it to me. Comm Team members will be talking with folks to arrange times to record for those who don&rsquo;t want to record their own. Here are the prompts to help inspire you:</p>

<li><p>What is your dream vacation?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe your perfect day –</p></li>
<li><p>What is the best vacation you have taken and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have any hobbies? How to you get involved in them?</p></li>

<ul>
<li> Where are you from?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Are you field staff? If so, where domiciled?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s your favorite color/animal/book/movie?<br>
*Among your friends or family, what are you famous for?<br>
*When was the last time you changed your opinion / belief about something major?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the best compliment you&rsquo;ve received?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever had a nickname? What is it?</p></li>
<li><p>What&rsquo;s your favorite family tradition?</p></li>
<li><p>If you had a warning label, what would yours say?</p></li>

<p>Shout Outs</p>

<p>From Lisa: I would like to give a shout out to Terri Wilcox. I have a client in Iowa City that has been very hesitant to try or do anything as she is constantly questioning herself. This client has been faithfully attending Terri’s braille class and support group in Iowa City. The client was never taught braille at the braille school because she had some vision. She started taking braille through a Hadley course and agreed to attend Terri’s class. The client has absolutely bloomed in Terri’s class. She just bought herself an Orbit and downloaded two books to read. The client told me yesterday that she is going to return her print book to Hadley and use the Orbit to read the book in braille. Great job Terri!<br>

Center Update</p>

<p>From the Center, both Jessie and Joy completed small meals this week. Jessie made fajitas, rice and fruit coffee cake, and Joy made lo mein noodles with chicken, egg rolls, and peach cobbler for dessert. Jennifer completed her drop off, and Joy was able to complete the first half of the internet curriculum. In addition she has started to work on her Post center tools. These are tools that will allow her to have what she needs in order to succeed beyond training. When Joy started she did not know how to type, and had no confidence in herself when it comes to using a computer. Her positive attitude has allowed her to move past any challenges brought by her limited knowledge of technology. When Richard arrived at the center, he had a very limited scope when it comes to his future employment. However, as he gets ready to complete the internet unit, he has made comments on how he is expanding his view of the types of jobs he wants to do.<br>
Also the request for Proposals for the student apartments is live. Thanks to Al and Cheri for all their work on this. <br>

It is expected that this will just be for one day. In any case, he will send a reminder email the day of . Thanks to everyone for their patience with this!<br>

<p>Enrique sent a thought provoking article that is below in the Additional Articles section. It is called “Not Blind to Color in the Federation: A Panel on the Experience of Black and Blind in America” Here are a couple of other resources that he shared:<br>
DART masks.<br>
When riding DART there are masks for riders. They are located immediately to the right of the door as you walk on to the bus. They are right up against the window. Note that these masks are not supposed to last you all day. In fact, they disintegrate after about 3 hours or so.<br>
Red Cross First Aid App.<br>
After taking the first aid class. Thank you Kathy). Kathy told us about the Red Cross First aid app for Android and iOS. I went ahead and downloaded the iOS version and found that it was very useful. It not only has all the slides and steps that we learned about on first aid class, but it has additional options that help as guides when administering first aid, and preparing a first aid kit. They even have a couple of first aid kits for sale. There is also the option of calling 9-1-1 from within the app. As well as the location of nearby medical centers. I found that other than the descriptions of the pictures the app is very accessible. The paragraphs describing how to administer first aid are clear, and easy to follow. I have not yet downloaded the Android version, but I would not be surprised if it is also accessible.<br>

We held a really great discussion about these webinars on Wednesday. We actually talked until I was too hungry to continue and we are going to pick it up again on the 26th.

<p>If you order food, you need to meet the delivery person at the door. This is especially important if you are paying with cash or need to give a cash tip as you will risk the food being returned to the restaurant.. If pre-paid food is delivered and no one is there to receive it, it will be put on a shelf under the microwave in the break room. No one will be expected to monitor this shelf or ensure food is given to the correct owner. It is a good idea to put in the delivery instructions that they need to deliver to the north door (Watson-Powwel) </p>

<p>From Lisa: The following is a shout out to Drew from my client. She was very appreciative and complimentary of Drew. She said that he has been extremely helpful and always responds to her questions or concerns. She said that Drew will explain things more than one way if she doesn’t understand. She said that he is really good, if he says he will do something he follows through and does it.</p>

Kayla has started teaching braille in the center, while Nami has had a new edition to her family. The kitchens have been busy and August is and September is bringing lots of student meals.</p>

<p>##Director Updates<br>
 We had a great New Staff Seminar last week. It was a bit different with our presenters coming in via Zoom, but we had some great conversation and everyone gave great presentations. I want to thank everyone who helped make the week possible &ndash; Maintenance for setting up 2W, all the managers for presenting (especially Keri for running the acronym game and bringing candy), Janice for all the scheduling, and everyone for being patient with all of us who got behind on our emails because we took this time to concentrate on our blindness philosophy. </p>

<p>Director&rsquo;s Forum fell on the New Staff Seminar week, so I folded it in to the seminar. I shared about the YATP FAQ and that IESBVI has asked us to put out a one pager on youth services. I also shared that we will be working on putting together info for our ask for the Governor&rsquo;s office and interested parties by the end of the month. <br>
Don’t forget that we have the 4th Tuesday All Agency Chat philosophy discussion edition this Tuesday 12:30-1:30. Here is the link:</p>

<p>From Kelsi: The transportation team is working on a project to consolidate transportation resources, and is creating a training curriculum to help clients become more comfortable traveling in their local areas and around the world. The transportation team would like real stories about transportation blunders from you- We would like to show how these situations happen to all of us at one time or another regardless of experience. If interested in participating, please send Kelsi a brief email at <a href="mailto:kelsi.hansen@blind.state.ia.us">kelsi.hansen@blind.state.ia.us</a> summarizing your experience.

<p>Reminder: AR: Required Viewing for All Staff Meeting on Friday, September 18th</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the leadership team viewed and discussed a set of webinars created by the folks who created the Crucial Conversations training. We held a really great discussion about these webinars on Wednesday. We actually talked until I was too hungry to continue and we are going to pick it up again on the 26th. One of the action steps that came out of this discussion was that we want to talk about concepts explained in the first webinar across the agency. In order to do this, we are asking all staff to have watched this webinar and taken the time to think about it before we discuss on September 18th. While we have made a lot of improvements in our communication and culture in recent years, we want to truly become an organization based on truth rather than an organization based on power. Managers will be following up and more information will be shared in coming weeks, but we wanted to give folks as much lead time as possible to make sure everyone had time to think about the webinar after watching it. For this discussion, we will be focusing in on the first session about 200% Accountability. This is the one you are required to watch for this meeting. The second webinar is very good also and we will hopefully focus on this one at a later time. Here is the link:</p>

<h2 id="toc_859">AR: Locking Offices</h2>

<p>Looking at priorities and resources for our facilities folks with the introduction of a new team member, it came up that custodians were needing to shift later to lock up and locking up took about 40 minutes. I know it is nice to have maintenance folks come lock doors and make sure lights are turned off, but we are all professionals who are perfectly capable of doing this for ourselves. Maintenance staff will still make sure 3rd and 4th lobby doors, elevators, the main office door, DCR, copy room, and assembly room are locked at 4:15, but we are going to trust each other to lock our own office doors and turn off our own lights when we leave. I have faith we can all  build this habit if we haven&rsquo;t already. If you are not used to doing this, you can put a post-it note on your door handle to remind you. Thanks for taking a few seconds a day to help our facilities folks save more than an hour a week. Also just a reminder to flush twice when using the 1st floor women&rsquo;s restroom. There is a water pressure issue and this helps everything go down better.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_860">Congratulations Joyce</h2>

<p>Well, we all knew this was coming, but Joyce has officially announced her retirement on September 18th. She shared the below note and I&rsquo;ll give a little warning: this may cause tering up and/or crying</p>

<p>To the entire staff:<br>
I can’t believe I started this ride almost 25 years ago.  I have made so many great friends through the years.  I have seen numerous blind Iowan’s come into the orientation center feeling very unsure of themselves and it is so fun to watch each of them grow the confidence to go out and tackle the world with a renewed independence and great pride in what they have accomplished.  I know that each and every employee at IDB has played a part in this, regardless whether you realize it or not.  </p>

<p>I had a great time working with you all and hope that we will continue to stay in touch.   While I will miss you all, I am looking forward to a future without these strange times, and for days those days my husband and I will be out playing music for our seniors in various retirement homes and care facilities.   </p>

<p>I wish you all the best in the future.</p>

<p>It would be very helpful if folks used command strips or hooks to hang any pictures or decorations you&rsquo;d like to have on your workspace walls. Blue painters tape also works nicely for temporary things. If there is an existing nail, feel free to use it, but it keeps spaces nicer if we don&rsquo;t add any new holes in the walls. Thanks for helping out with by doing this!</p>

<h2 id="toc_863">Director&rsquo;s Updates</h2>

<p>I am really excited to have NEW Staff Seminar coming up the week of August 17th. Because we were not able to meet as planned in April and we have so many new folks since then, some of the folks that would typically participate will hold off and be in the winter 2021 group. We have some hiring currently happening and a few more coming up, so we will have another large group after the holidays. We will hopefully have dates for the winter session on the calendar next week. Those in this session should get some welcome info and instructions shortly.  </p>

<p>Folks may have noticed that there are a bunch of new staff in the center for training. Folks have probably also noticed that some people are in staff training longer than others. Each individual has goals worked out with their supervisor and Al to make sure that their time is as productive as possible. Some folks come in having been through blindness training before. Teachers have more expectations around mastery of blindness skills than counselors or do and counselors have  extensive  expectations around believing in the capabilities of blind people. Plus every person is different. Also everyone is   dealing with the extra challenges created by COVID. This is all to explain that training times are going to vary pretty widely. Please keep this in mind. Training doesn&rsquo;t rhyme with shaming and they don&rsquo;t go together :) NO one should feel bad because they are in staff training longer than someone else and no one should look down on anyone because they were in training more time than another person in the same position. I came right out of training in our center and spent more than 3 months in staff training when I was hired at BLIND, Inc. At the time I felt insulted, but looking back, I can see where I really needed it and how much it helped me to grow more quickly into  being a better teacher.  </p>

<p>A big thanks again to Cheri for compiling and entering our annual performance report. It&rsquo;s not really a financial thing and kind of just got passed down from Bruce to Andrew to her.</p>

<h2 id="toc_865">LEAP parent program</h2>

<p>The ETT folks will provide a LEAP wrap up update after this week, but I wanted to let folks know that we are modifying the usual ending event in light of the current times. As there are fewer students this year, there will be fewer families attending. They will come into the assembly room and have all the presentations and lunch there. The students are pre-plating and simplifying the lunch and families will sit together and remain socially distanced. It has taken a bit of work to figure out how the teens could still demonstrate their ability to cook and serve a meal and have this important point of pride and I want to thank the LEAP staff for figuring this out. Talking with families and impressing on them the importance of continuing to have high expectations for their kids is so important. It&rsquo;s so easy to fall back into old habits and let the take on the low expectations that will be all around these kids as they go back to their home communities. It has been an enormous amount of work to make this program happen as safely as possible while getting the youth the training they need. This holds true for the center and the upcoming Young Adult Transition Program (YATP) as well. I can say how much I appreciate everyone&rsquo;s work to make these programs happen, but more important is the difference they are making in the lives of the students. </p>

<h2 id="toc_866">Scaffolding going up Monday over the main entrance</h2>

<p>From Sarah b.: I want to give a shout out to the library staff. Their ability to handle all of the requests for braille materials and sending it out to the clients has made my job easier and more effective. Thanks to them I can not only get braille into the hands of our clients but give them new articles, books, and lessons to work through during this time.</p>

<h2 id="toc_873">AR: Clarification to In Person Services Rules</h2>

<p>We are needing to make two changes to the rules document. First, we need all staff who are continuing to telework beyond August 15th and have not already done so, to complete a telework agreement. Please work with your supervisor on this. We are working with our personnel officer on wording for work rules surrounding telework expectations and hope to have them to share with everyone shortly. The goal is to ensure that everyone who is productive and focused in their work. Secondly, we added the below item to the list of expectations for all staff and as there has been some question about this:<br>
will not allow guests into the building anywhere other than the first floor and will ensure that any guest in this context is wearing a mask at all times. A “guest” is defined as any person who does not either have a business reason that requires their presence in the building or have permission to stay in the building apartments or dorms. <br>
will not allow delivery persons to use the East door or allow them to go beyond the front desk area of the building. We are not trying to be unfriendly, we just want to reduce risk to everyone in the building by ensuring that only people who need to be in the building are in the building. Thanks for your help with this.</p>

We would like to extend an invitation for those of you who are interested in joining us on the Holiday Tea Committee. If you are, the next meeting is Wednesday August 5 at 8:00 AM in the Directors Conference Room. We enjoy coming up with new themes every year and to make each one the best Holiday Tea for the best staff! It’s a time when we can gather and get to know our co-workers a little more on a personal level. There’s lots of food, fun, &amp; fellowship, although, this year may be different due to the Pandemic. If you are at all interested, join us at our next meeting. Be sure you get your supervisor’s approval. The Holiday Tea Committee </p>

<h2 id="toc_876">IDB One Page Overview</h2>

<p>In order to expand ways folks can volunteer to support IDB, we have created a one page overview of the agency. It was not easy to get it down to one page and we couldn’t include everything. But we wanted it to be one page so that folks could print some out at home and take them to their doctor or community center or library or wherever folks may come into contact with the information. It can be found at:<br>

<h2 id="toc_877">Director Updates</h2>

<p>Thanks to Hanna G. for catching a part of the dress code that was a little unclear. The below line was updated to reflect that plain crew or v-neck shirts could be business casual rather than a T-shirt:<br>
Blouses or shirts (crew or v-neck), golf or polo shirts, turtlenecks. <br>
Thanks to Sharonda for one great question and one great idea. At all agency chat, she asked why there were more ICUb announcements than NFBI ones in Coffee Talk lately. I explained I put in what I receive. I do my best to grab all the emails, but occasionally I’ll miss something. So if there is any blindness related event or announcement event that is not posted on the ICUB or NFBI official list servs, please share it with me and I’ll do my best to get it out there. If you have articles that share our positive view of blindness and promote high expectations for blind people to include, please also do send. The great idea was to call the “all Agency Chat Philosophy Discussion” “Empower Hour”., so I’m going to do that.<br>
Our leadership team participated in the second part of the Crucial Conversations webinar series this week. The link is below for those who are interested. I found there was a lot of reference to the Crucial Conversations book/trainings with which I was unfamiliar, so I’m working on reading the book to help me better understand what was being conveyed. <br>

This training is part of our affirmative action plan. Another initiative coming from this plan is the creation of a task force to help us come up with ways we can get more minorities to apply to our open positions and also provide the best possible resumes and cover letters to get them selected for interviews. If this is a project that you feel you have interest in, please let me know. <br>
Another interesting and interestingly related resource I came across this week was a podcast talking with a researcher and author working to teach people how to overcome cognitive bias. It has some real practical tips that can be used at work. One that I have been trying to use is delaying. I tend to be an emotional and reactive person, so making myself pause before responding helps me to respond in a much more effective way. I also really appreciate the idea of realizing that it is very unlikely that the initial story I’m creating around any incident is complete and I need to keep my mind open to new information. One part I’m finding hard to implement is giving more points when evaluating Iowa State or Cubs fans to compensate for my natural reaction to their poor choice of teams :) There is also discussion of the group attribution error that has very clear implications for addressing misconceptions about blindness and blind people.

<p>From Al: From the center, Kay completed her drop off this week, and should be done in the center after next week. Terry started his novel, and Richard is on his last article before his novel. Sewing is one thing in the Center that either makes students want to throw something, or they excel with. Joy is a newer student in the Center and has created a new standard; she was able to thread her needle and sew 3 different styles of button onto a square of fabric in 15 minutes flat. Not only that, this was her first experience sewing anything, ever! From the kitchens, students, not house elves, cooked pies, lasagna, chicken and rice, homemade taco pizza (from a mystery ingredient project), scones, waffles, cinnamon rolls, chocolate chip pumpkin bread, roasts, and grilled meats such as chicken and burgers this week.</p>

<h2 id="toc_882">AR: If you are coming in to the building on weekends</h2>

<p>In order to keep from scaring apartment staff doing building security rounds on the weekends, please remember to text the duty phone when you are arriving and leaving if you are going to be in the building during the weekends or holidays. Also if you unlock a hallway door on 3rd or 4th, , please remember to re-lock it. Thanks much!</p>

<h2 id="toc_883">Technology Support</h2>

<p>From Helen: We want to provide an update of who is currently in the building when. Wes is generally in the office Monday and Tuesday from 8 to 5, and Craig is generally in the office Monday and Wednesday from 7 to 4:30. They can come in other times as needed with prior arrangement. When thinking about whom to call first with a question, please call Craig for computer and phone issues, and Wes for eFORCE or screen reader issues. Whenever possible though, please do use the Wufoo forms to help us track and manage issues. </p>

<h2 id="toc_884">4+ Program Update</h2>

<p>From Helen: Our Young Adult Transition Program (YATP) will begin August 23. We will have 5 students participating this year. Thank you to everyone who has worked to help get this program started.

<p>SELF weeks will still be happening this year, and applications for the October sessions are due August 25. Any active VR client is welcome to apply. We will let clients know as soon as possible after applications close who has been accepted into each session. The flyer is attached.</p>

<h2 id="toc_886">Director Updates</h2>

<p>I shared with folks a couple of weeks ago that we would not likely have money for in grade increase (raises tied to evaluations) this year. Cheri was still holding out hope we could do something for folks, but when all the numbers went into the system, it is very tight. In addition to the surprise $29,000 increase in our OCIO bill, we had more than $59,000 in increases in our direct and indirect costs from DAS. These are all administrative costs and those tend to be 90% state dollars and 10% federal dollars. We are making it work, but there are tough choices. I am really sorry not to be able to offer the in grade increases. The state salary structure is not fair and I know how many folks are not getting paid nearly what they are worth and I wish I could change that. But we are going to get through these times and keep empowering blind Iowans to be gainfully employed and live independently. <br>
I’ve asked all members of the leadership team to participate in the webinar series.: “ Crucial Conversations to Create and Sustain More Equitable Workplaces.” The executive summary and link to the recording of the first of the two sessions is below. We will be discussing where we are at and how we can create a culture based on truth rather than power. . I would really appreciate hearing from everyone wishing to share their thoughts and ideas on this critical subject. I’d be excited to talk about it at the 2nd Tuesday all Agency Chat or feel free to send me an email or discuss with your supervisor <br>
Executive Summary: “We are in the midst of a global movement to root out racism and racial injustice. For too long, people have been discriminated against because of their race. Organizational leaders are looking for solutions to ensure their policies, procedures, and cultures—which is to say their people—are inclusive of and fair to everyone.”<br>

While I have a lot more questions than answers at this point i know that it needs to happen at all levels and especially from me. Everyone at this agency needs to know they can pull me up and I need to embrace that. This will be a challenge for me personally, but I’m going to embrace it.<br>
So one particular way I learned that I had messed up recently was in our dress code. I don’t like that I needed to be told by DAS that our dress code should not be gender specific. I should have caught that years ago and to anyone who felt less welcome at our agency because of it, I apologize and will work to do better. The silver lining on this is that it has been a good reminder for me that I need to keep growing . I came across a great episode of The Happiness Lab with Dr. Laurie Santos with the title “How to Be a Better Ally.” It may be helpful to any and all of us, looking to do better in all sorts of ways including sighted folks thinking about how they can help to stop anti-blind ableism. Here is the link: <br>
<a href="https://overcast.fm/+TXrDuGqtk">https://overcast.fm/+TXrDuGqtk</a><br>
So below is the revised dress code. I’ve went through it with the leadership team and it’s been blessed by DAS. We borrowed pretty heavily from our colleagues at Inspections and Appeals. I think it explains why we have a dress code, what that entails, and what flexibilities there can be. If you find something that is unclear or out of alignment with our values, please let me know by the end of the day 7/30. </p>

<h2 id="toc_887">Dress Code Draft</h2>

<p>Revised July 2020<br>
As employees of the Iowa Department for the Blind, the citizens of Iowa hold us to a high standard, and our personal appearance creates a favorable or unfavorable impression on our co-workers, clients, patrons, and the public. It is therefore important for all employees to present a positive, professional image. Employees of the department shall maintain a clean, neat and well-groomed appearance and dress in a professional, businesslike manner. Employees of the department are expected to dress in business casual attire following the guidelines below unless work assignments involve job locations or duties that cannot be performed in business casual attire. Field staff may be allowed to deviate from this policy as circumstances dictate and as authorized by their supervisor. Appropriate attire is required when you are attending a training or meeting with outside groups.<br>
Business Casual Attire<br>
Appropriate business casual attire may include:<br>
Dresses, dress suits, dress or casual slacks (including capris), skirts, khakis. Blazers, sport coats, sweaters, vests, cardigans. Blouses or shirts, golf or polo shirts, turtlenecks. Dress shoes, pumps, loafers, flat shoes, dress sandals, and boots. Inappropriate business casual attire may include, but is not limited to:<br>
Halter, tank, and tube tops. Shorts of any kind. Exceptions include shorts worn by instructors teaching cane travel during warm weather. T-shirts, sweatshirts, denim jeans (any color). Athletic shoes, beach sandals, or pool/deck shoes. Bib overalls, sweatpants, athletic work out suits, spandex pants, leggings (unless worn under a dress or skirt), yoga pants. Clothing with offensive language or images. Casual Dress Attire<br>
Casual dress attire needs to be appropriate for the professional work environment and must also be neat, clean, in good repair and appropriate for the situation. For office-based staff, casual dress attire days include Fridays, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day. Field-based staff shall be dressed appropriately for their work. Appropriate casual dress attire includes any items appropriate as business casual, and may also include:<br>
Denim jeans that do not have holes, stains, tears, ragged hems or excessive fading. Athletic shoes. Inappropriate casual attire includes, but is not limited to:<br>
Halter, tank, or tube tops. Shorts of any kind. Exceptions include instructors teaching cane travel during warm weather. beach sandals or pool/deck shoes. Bib overalls, sweatpants, athletic workout suits, spandex pants, leggings (unless worn under a dress or skirt), yoga pants. Clothing with offensive language or images. The success of this policy rests with the good judgment of every IDB employee. If an employee’s clothing is not appropriate and does not project a professional image, it is expected the employee’s supervisor will respectfully discuss the concern with the employee. Repeated occurrences of wearing inappropriate attire may result in disciplinary action.<br>
If you would like to request an exemption or variation from the dress code for medical or religious reasons, please contact your supervisor.</p>

While we got some nice participation and attendance at the beginning for the all agency chat, it dropped off and I figure it is a good time to mix it up a bit. I’m moving the chat to 12:30-1:30 on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month. The 2nd Tuesday is an opportunity to share ideas, ask questions, give suggestions, and chat about programs and initiatives. The 4th Tuesday is a philosophy discussion. I know with the world being as it is right now, attending business class in person-is not always possible for folks, so attending these virtual blindness issue discussions can count toward continuing education requirements. <br>

<h2 id="toc_896">Resolution on Older Blind Federal Funding</h2>

<p>From Kim: Below is a copy of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) Resolution for 2020. We know the NFB convention will need to decide or vote if this will be one of their legislative priorities. Should it become a priority, they will still need to draft the bill then that bill would have to pass the U.S. House then go to the U.S. Senate. If and when the bill passed and what it will look like on the other end, only time will tell. So below is the resolution - happy reading:<br>
Resolution 2020-16: Regarding an Increase in Funding for the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind Program Through the Rehabilitation Services Administration WHEREAS, Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind (OIB) is a program funded through the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) that provides training and accessible technology for individuals fifty-five years or older who are blind, to increase their ability to live independently and care for their individual needs; and WHEREAS, for the past three fiscal years the OIB program has been awarded $33,317,000 each year; and WHEREAS, the American Community Survey estimated that in 2018 there were 4,584,000 blind people who were fifty-five or older and, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), this number should increase rapidly due to diabetes and other chronic diseases that cause blindness; and WHEREAS, with $33,317,000 awarded to the OIB program each of the past three years to serve an eligible population of approximately 4,584,000 individuals (approximately $7.27 per eligible individual), this funding is woefully inadequate; and WHEREAS, the National Federation of the Blind knows that blindness is not the characteristic that defines one’s abilities, and, given the proper technology and training, blind people can live the lives they want; and WHEREAS, in order for blind people to fully participate in their communities, they must have access to technology such as screen readers, smart phones, and Braille notetakers and training to use them, as well as training in orientation and mobility and independent living skills; and WHEREAS, the limited funding for the OIB program is far from adequate to cover the cost of such access technology, which often ranges from $1,000 to $6,000, as well as quality training to meet the needs of the individual: Now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the National Federation of the Blind in Convention assembled this eighteenth day of July, 2020, that this organization urge Congress to substantially increase funding for the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind program, so that older individuals who are blind can get the training and technology needed to live with complete independence, social integration, individual productivity, and personal dignity.</p>

<p>From Sarah W.: The Library has been a host site this summer for the Iowa STEM Teacher Externship program. Nikki Sobotka who teaches math at Southeast Polk Junior High joined the library staff on June 1st, specifically working with Tyler. Nikki has spent six weeks this summer assisting the Library in the development of training, guidelines and resources for educators around providing accessible educational materials for Iowa students, with a focus on STEM areas of study. Nikki also had the opportunity to learn about IDB, the library and creating accessible content. She will be able to bring back to her school and to her students how to apply accessibility to all aspects of STEM. It was great to have Nikki with us this summer, we have all learned so much about working with students and schools. I would like to thank Nikki for sharing her expertise with us.</p>

From Al: Tours will be starting again soon for clients only. This would exclude more of the informational tours that we sometimes do. The rules around this follow the general rules we have setup for our building and for the center, but would additionally restrict tours to no more than 3 people. We are asking that the clients would be notified ahead of time that masks are to be worn during the whole tour as well as the other guidelines that we are asking building guests to follow. Cindy, Hannah, and Jennifer, all completed their shop projects this week, and I am happy to say that hannah has completed her center training and is moving on to Helens ETT pastures. This seems fitting since her shop project was a chicken tractor. Please check with her if you have no idea what that is as I hadn’t a clue. The students are back next week so lets get ready to rumble!!!</p>

<h2 id="toc_904">Director Updates</h2>

<p>We had a good turn out for Director’s Forum today. I shared about our call with RSA regarding data dashboards and that they were asking about the number of clients exiting after receiving services but no longer interested in services. We’ll be having our quarterly VR TeamFest Thursday morning and we will talk about how that relates to our goals for PY20 (VR data is collected by program year and PY20 runs from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.) I also shared that we, like all state agencies, received an incredibly large increase to our OCIO bill without any warning just as the fiscal year ended. This means we are needing to find a way to cut $30,000 in administrative costs during this fiscal year to pay this bill. <br>
AS we are in a new state fiscal year, Committees (Food Bank, Toys for Tots, ERC, Holiday Tea) need to meet and elect a chair for the year by the end of July. Please let me know who is elected so I can communicate about all staff meetings, etc.<br>
The Communications Team will be changing with the new fiscal year as well. We are switching the positions to a two year term and staggering which spots go on/off to allow for better continuity. A few folks will be carried over. A big thanks to Susan, Lynnette, John, and Hannah G. for serving over the past year. Tim West and Drew will be continuing on and will be joined by Jim, Jennifer K., Joe W. Karly, and Kelsi. If you have ideas for initiatives to improve internal or external communications at IDB, please share them with these team members.</p>

Also all you VR folks, please get all June data in the system today (Monday)!<br>
Last Monday the Iowa Commission for the Blind approved a grant of $231,202 from the Gifts &amp; Bequests fund to fill the gap between what Governor Reynolds had recommended and our final level-funded appropriation. This will help us to begin the Young Adult Transition Program (4+) and better cover our rising personnel costs. This will be extremely helpful in weathering the financial uncertainty of this time. I am very grateful to the Commission Board for their understanding of the challenges created by these extraordinary times and all of the support they have provided. <br>
I have been asked to serve on the Economic Recovery Advisory Board’s Expanding Iowa’s Workforce Workgroup. The charge of this workgroup is  “Workforce is charged with finding innovative and creative ways to address the challenges Iowans face in the wake of the pandemic as well as identifying how to increase opportunities for all Iowans especially those in our underserved and minority communities.” I will be working to take this opportunity to raise awareness of IDB’s services, particularly services to business, and hope to encourage employers to reconsider misconceptions they may have about hiring blind people. <br>
Because of a scheduling conflict, Director’s Forum will be held at noon on July 10th rather than July 17th. </p>

<h2 id="toc_914">Center Updates</h2>

<p>From Karly: Sheldon came into the center nervous, quiet, and had never done much cooking on her own other than the microwave. She follows directions like a champ and wanted to make a coconut cream pie for her dad. She also found a recipe she wanted to use on her own and decided to use this instead of a recipe I found, which I was happy about because she took the initiative, saying she was feeling more relaxed in the kitchen than she has ever felt. She went to town with it on Tuesday, finished her filling and baked it yesterday. The first couple of weeks she was here she was shy, quiet and had said she was nervous to talk because people would tell her to be quiet. After her pie was done yesterday, she had such a positive attitude, and I was so happy to see this progression from when she started. She was more talkative and said she was proud of herself and she mentioned that she is feeling more comfortable with talking to people because she never felt that what she said was worth much before coming to the center. I cannot wait to see her continued positive attitude and progression throughout her training. Also, Terry made a meal of baked chicken, green beans, yellow rice, and homemade chocolate pudding. Since he could not serve it to anyone here, he was able to take it home and enjoy it for dinner.</p>

<h2 id="toc_921">Director’s updates</h2>

<p>I think most folks have heard the legislature flat funded most of state government this year. In response, we are asking for support from the Commission Board and the Gifts and Bequests Fund. It was a tough decision, as I really don’t like doing this, but these are very extraordinary times. While this pandemic is without precedent, asking for G&amp;B support for IDB programs is not. Here is the summary of the request:<br>
In January, Governor Reynolds included a total increase of our state appropriation of $231,202 in her budget proposal. This included $64,865 for salaries and $166,337 to support our new young adult (4+) program. In February, we gave a joint presentation with IESBVI to the Education Appropriation Subcommittee regarding the need for our 4+ program which was well-received. In March, the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic dramatically altered the economy, government operations, and so many aspects of daily life. This catastrophic event forced the legislature to take a very cautious approach to the 2021 state budget. As a result, the majority of agencies, including IDB, received level funding. <br>
Because of these unprecedented and unforeseeable events, IDB is asking for a grant from the Gifts &amp; Bequests fund in the amount of $231,202. This is the increase recommended by the Governor in her original budget. This additional funding will allow us to better maintain current staffing levels in the face of rising personnel costs. Because the Independent Living Program depends so heavily on state dollars, it is the most vulnerable when we are flat funded or de-appropriated. We feel that cuts to these services would be devastating to those we serve. We also need to fund our young adult (4+) program through its first year of operation. There are young adults in need of this program currently we very much need to serve. This is a one-time request and IDB will seek additional appropriation in SFY22 to cover all of these costs moving forward. <br>
Also I’d like to share a few reminders about evaluations. Please use your electronic signature to sign your evaluation and return it to your supervisor as a word documents. The supervisor will then sign and send it to me as a word doc. I then read it, comment (below the signature lines), and sign it. I then save it as a PDF and send it to our personnel assistant to be put in the DAS system, Janice to put in our files, you and your supervisor so you both have final copies, and Cheri to track salary increases. It’s a bit of a process, but it works very well when we wait to make a PDF after everyone has signed. If you have any questions, please let me or your supervisor know. </p>

<h2 id="toc_922">Fireworks On The Roof</h2>

<p>In past years, staff could bring family and friends to watch the fireworks on our roof deck. Unfortunately, with the public health situation, we can’t have this this year.

I understand the change in front desk hours this might be a little inconvenient for some folks and do apologize for that, but it will really help the library get done the work they need to get done serving students and patrons and still allow for package delivery and walk-in services. Thanks for your assistance and understanding. Here is what the sign will say:<br>
In order to maintain optimal staffing in all areas, the Iowa Department for the Blind’s walk-in hours are now 9:00-2:00. If you are needing assistance with entry to the building between 8:00-9:00 or 2:00-4:30, please call 515-452-1335.</p>

<h2 id="toc_929">Parking Reminder</h2>

<p>If you are wanting to continue to use IDB parking, you do need to pay the $50 for June and then the $65 thereafter. If folks are not intending to continue, please return your parking pass to Janice. You may drop it off or mail it in. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="toc_930">Pre-ETS Virtual Trainings Updates</h2>

<p>From Keri (in collaboration with David DeNotaris): I had the pleasure of welcoming students to the first IA ACE Academy Online program earlier this week. We had 10 students accepted into this program this summer. ACE= Advocacy, Communications to Employment. The online workshops are designed for students who are blind or have low vision. The ACE Academy Online program is delivered by David J. DeNotaris &amp; Eileen Rivera Ley of Sky’s the limit Communications. David and Eileen are both blind and draw on years of professional experience in the corporate, government and nonprofit fields to assist the students in learning the necessary skills to be successful at school, work and the community.<br>
David and Eileen truly believe in the potential of students who are blind and have found that individuals with disabilities are the most untapped talent pool for employers to consider, said DeNotaris from his home in Hershey, PA. The training is delivered on Zoom, and participants learn from successfully employed individuals that just happen to have a disability. Students learn advocacy, interpersonal, literacy, interviewing, daily living and networking skills designed to help the students achieve their academic, independent living and employment goals! </p>

<p>On June 16, 2020 we also began our  first IDB Dream Big Summer program. Through this program we are contracting with Lisa Shaw and Ruth Mwangangi of Mosaic Haven. Through this program, seven students are participating in an interactive program focused on discovering options for training following high school. The students are engaged through Zoom and participating in a number of interest and skills inventories, learning about setting goals, developing strategies and raising expectations about options after graduation. These students are participating in this program for four weeks. In the fall we will be discussing ways to do college visits and program tours (as available) as a “part 2” of the program. Through initial contact with students in both programs, they are finding them to be engaging and informative. We are really looking forward to hearing more from students about their experiences as they move through both of these programs!</p>

<h2 id="toc_931">Cell Phone update</h2>

<p>From Helen&quot; We have switched all phone lines on our Verizon account to unlimited minute plans for the time being. This means that everyone can call land lines, conference lines, Zoom rooms, etc. without us running out of minutes. Eventually we can switch the people who only use a few minutes per month back to minute plans once things settle down. Included in this change is a hot spot for every iPhone user, so if you did not have one in the past you do now. Verizon limits our data at the following points: Hot Spots, 10GB/month, regular data, 25GB/month. After this point your data speed will slow down significantly, though it will continue to work without causing overage fees.</p>

<p>From Susan:Last week I was able to meet with a few clients that were needing in person visits. I explained when I called, to set up the visit, the procedures and protocol the Department for the Blind has in place. As I met with each one they were very appreciative of the opportunity to get to meet face to face. At each visit I offered to meet with them outside but they were very comfortable with me coming into their home. They each stated how much they appreciated the extra steps we are taking by wearing mask, using hand sanitizer and gloves. Using Clorox wipes to wipe equipment we worked on or items that I provided for them. </p>

<h2 id="toc_940">Library Donation note</h2>

<p>Our mother, Eleanor L. Frenzel, passed away on April 27, 2020 at the Wilton Retirement Community, Memory Care Unit, Wilton, IA. Unfortunately, she was a victim of Covid 19, so it has been a difficult time. Mom has used your Audio Book Service for many years. She suffered from macular degeneration and was nearly blind at the time of her death. The Iowa Dept. for the Blind Library Services has been such an important part of Mom’s life for so many years, we decided this would be a great memorial to honor her passing. I am enclosing a donation in memory of Eleanor L. Frenzel, Wilton, IA, in the amount of $400.00 for the Audio Book Services Library. </p>

<h2 id="toc_964">Roof Garden Note of Appreciation</h2>

<p>I think we are all really appreciative of Darren and Hanna’s work on this and are all really excited to get to see and touch and smell i it for ourselves. For new folks, the roof garden was dedicated to our former industrial arts teacher, Ric Franbach, who passed away last fall. <br>
From Hanna: Since probably December or January, I have been badgering Darren with all of my splendid plans and ideas on how to fix up our roof garden and what projects students could be doing down in the shop to get us ready for our gardening season (the best season of the year, as we all know). Of course, as soon as it was time to really get to work on making the magic happen, the pandemic came about and students were let out, and unable to help us with our project. It was such a let down, but Darren really stuck with it and made it the best situation he could. He created our awesome gutter gardens on the east side of the roof, and built a beautiful frame around my hand-painted sign. Our sign reads “Frambach Gardens&#39; and has a thistle on the right side, in memory of Ric’s love for his Scottish heritage. Sue, Ric’s wife, was even kind enough to bring in 3 of Ric’s favorite plants from their own personal garden to be added in. Darren is building some awesome matching planters for these plants, and as soon as our elevator is working we will have those up there as well! He’s cleaned up and re-painted all of the planters, and did so much work up there to really make the place come alive again. So far on the roof, I’ve planted mesclun, radishes, beets, cucumber, chives, onion, peas, 3 varieties of tomato, sweet and hot peppers, parsley, lemon balm, spearmint, watermelon, green onion, basil, cilantro, orange mint mentha, lily of the valley, bleeding hearts, petunia, marigold, lilac, lilies, and lots of wildflowers! Phew. It’s been a project but we can’t wait for everyone to start coming back in so you can all check it out! Thank you so much to Darren, for putting in so much time and effort to make our rooftop beautiful!</p>

<h2 id="toc_966">Director’s Updates</h2>

<p>We are coming really close to having a document to share regarding our return to work rules and guidelines. It’s been quite a process. We are targeting June 8th for opening the buildng’s front door and staffing the front desk. A big thanks to Joyce, Cheri, and Sarah W. for all their work around ordering masks, sneeze guards, and all the stuff we need to clean and reduce viral spread. We are also looking at allowing field staff to travel to see clients under specific conditions and using precautions. More details will be coming.<br>
There is a Commission Board meeting on June 2nd. We are limiting access to the Zoom and asking the public to call in using the ICN line. If you will be attending and would like to attend via Zoom, your supervisor can provide the link. We will be asking the board to approve an update to the Gifts &amp; Bequests guidelines that will make it easier for blind Iowans to get equipment needed to use the internet. We have all seen in recent months how much information is only available online and how much connecting with others is done online. We will also be asking the Board to approve an outline of which documents require Board approval when changed and which are procedures that do not require Board approval. These will be available in the Board packet next week. The Board packet, due to the logistical concerns in creating and sending hard copy, will not be mailed out before the meeting. <br>
All four of the operations updates prepared for the legislature are now up on our website on the reports page. There is a link to this page in the left side bar. <br>
Thanks to those who came to the chats this week. I’m going to open that Zoom up on Tuesday mornings from 8:00-9:00 starting June 2nd. We’ll see how this works and change it up if we need to. While numbers were small, the conversations were great and I look forward to chatting more in the coming weeks. I’d like to talk about how things are going, brainstorm solutions, share ideas, tips, etc. So bring some coffee, tea or soda if your one of those morning soda people. <br>
We had a great Director’s Forum today. There were good questions and lots of positivity. Dave Hammel shared that the Friends of the Library have received a donation from someone who’s mother was receiving books in her long-term care facility and depended so much on that service. I shared again how proud and grateful I am for all the hard work that all of you have been doing to keep services going and think out of the box to create new service models. <br>
I hope everyone has or had a fabulous weekend.</p>

<h2 id="toc_972">Director’s Updates</h2>

<p>Happy Monday! sorry to be a bit behind schedule this week. I’ve been working steadily on the updates to the IDB manual and guidelines for re-opening. Our leadership team has been working on obtaining supplies and discussing options. I met with my counterparts at IVRS, Ne Blind, NE General, MO Blind, and MO General and we all shared out ideas and plans. Another highlight of my week was interviewing folks for a permanent VRT for group trainings. We have had so much positivity regarding this pilot project and making it into a permanent position will enable us to do so much more. We all know how crucial peer support and regular braille practice are in helping our clients be successful. We also know how lonely it can be when you are the only blind person you know and how that effects your self-confidence and self-efficacy I know I’m not alone in having vivid memories of the first successful blind person I met and how that totally changed what I thought I could do and what I thought my life could be. For a number of folks, getting out of the house and attending a CBT is the first step toward attending the center and we all know how life changing that can be. I realized last week that I would rank finishing my graduation walk at the center as more impactful to me than completing my master’s thesis. I also realized that living in the dorms taught me more than any class I took, but that’s another essay :). So I’m really excited to be able to expand the outreach and infrastructure this pilot project has built. <br>
In the Region 7 meeting, I also heard about something NE General was doing I’m going to steal and modify to fit our agency :) I’d like to hear from anyone and everyone about how things are going. What are great parts of the current situation you want to keep going and what’s suboptimal and what can we do to make it better? I’ll be hanging out in the below Zoom from noon to 1:00 on Tuesday, May 19 and at 8:00-9:00 a.m. on Friday, May 22nd for anyone and everyone who wants to come and chat. </p>

<p>I moved Director’s Forum back one weekto May 22nd. . There are several proposals to combine workforce regions to be considered at this meeting and it is likely the local workforce areas will look very different if these proposals are approved. The proposals were made by the regions themselves in order to streamline the completion of the tasks rquired under WIOA and there will likely be no objections to them. <br>
Thanks to Hanna and the rest of the Communications Team, we will be starting two new mini features. Below is a link to use if you would like to share your birthday or employment anniversary day with the rest of our eh agency in the Upcoming Events section below. This will give folks a chance to get to tell you happy birthday or work anniversary. This is totally voluntary and opt-in as not everyone likes birthdays or being noticed in these ways, and that’s totally fine. We don’t want anyone to feel uncomfortable, we just want to add a little joy where possible. Here is the link: https://<br>
Secondly, this may take a little bit more planning and logistics, but we are looking to do quick little profiels for new staff and also existing staff to help us get to know one another a little better. There will be a brief chat about a topic you pick – family, hobbies, pets, etc. that we can share out. Right now all of us are feeling a lot of what those who work outside Des Moines probably feel pretty often, like we aren’t geting a chance to get to know one another, especially the new folks we are welcoming on board. More details to come!</p>

<h2 id="toc_979">May is Older Americans Month</h2>

<p>From Kim: The excerpt below comes from Administration for Community Living (ACL).<br>
“While we cannot celebrate it [Older Americans Month] as usual, we still encourage individuals and communities to reflect on the countless contributions that older adults make to our lives and nation. This year’s [Administration for Community Living’s] theme, “Make Your Mark,” highlights the difference everyone can make – in the lives of older adults, in support of caregivers, and to strengthen communities.”<br>

<h2 id="toc_980">Job Seeker Tip</h2>

<p>Below is an episode from a tech podcast where the programmer hosts were asked about getting a job as a programmer. There is great insight here for both those interested in programming related fields as well as anyone searching for a job generally. The more resumes I read and interviews I do, the more I realize how just a little effort and the ability to show interest in the place you are applying to can make a huge difference. </p>

<h2 id="toc_982">Reminder Parent Listening Sessions</h2>

<p>Please help spread the word, </p>

<p>IDB is working to launch several new cross-program initiatives to help youth gain independent living skills, develop self-efficacy, and be prepared for the world of work and adult life. We have been hearing from parents for several years about the need for additional support, resources, and training so that they can help their children take on age appropriate responsibilities, keep up with their peers, and make the transition from school to work in a way that results in their children becoming independent, well-adjusted, and successful adults. . One of these initiatives is the development of a parent advisory committee and a youth advisory committee to help guide our programs. We believe it is very important to ensure that our activities remain responsive to the needs of those we serve. In order to gain information that will guide our program design teams, we are inviting parents of blind and low vision youth to share their thoughts, ideas, and needs at our virtual listening sessions. <br>
Thees listening sessions will be held on Monday , May 11th at 10:00 am and Thursday, May 14th at 7:00 pm. <br>

<h2 id="toc_984">Quote of the Week</h2>

<p>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly” – Theodore Roosevelt</p>

<h2 id="toc_987">Director’s Updates</h2>

<p>Here we are at the end of week 6 for most of us in a new routine. Al doesn’t like it when anyone calls this “the new normal” and I get why. It’s a lot of change – especially in the where and how of our work. There are a lot of external stresses, uncertainties, and family concerns that weren’t a part of our lives three months ago. I hope folks in other parts of the state have had some of the great spring sunshine we’ve had in Des Moines. I hope you all are also being kind to yourselves and your colleagues and taking care of yourself. I’ve heard from folks how easy it is to just keep working when you are working from home. I get this and am trying to channel my inner Denise to remind me to drink water and get up and stretch. I also have had to work on not getting distracted by the games and wood working tools all around me :). Many of you also have kids home from school and parents and other family you are concerned about. I don’t think there is anyone right now without a lot to deal with. So honestly I am genuinely impressed with the ways you all are stepping up, figuring things out, and going the extra mile to get things done for clients and patrons. . I continue to be impressed by the ways folks are adapting and coming up with new modes of serving clients and patrons. There are blurbs about several of these below I’d encourage us all to learn and steal from. <br>
The legislature has postponed its return to session until at least the middle of the month. The Governor will be releasing a revised SFY21 budget very soon. It is not known yet how that budget will differ from the budget she proposed to the legislature back in January. Even if you aren’t following the news, you probably have a good sense that the crisis has impacted state revenue. I’ll keep folks posted once we learn more. Traditionally I like to be able to talk about in grade increase amounts at the June all staff meeting. I don’t know that we will know our appropriation by then, but considering the Governor’s original budget only included half of the money we asked for to address the cost of living adjustment negotiated into the union contract,, I need to be honest and say that the odds of there being money for merit based raises for anyone next year are very low. I hate saying this, because I and the entire leadership team very much wish to be able to reward excellent work with in grade increases, but it is just not very likely that we will have the money to do this. Every VR agency across the country is asking our federal funder about the waiver process for states failing to have enough state appropriation to meet their maintenance of effort requirements. The federal Secretary of Education asked Congress this week to include three potentially helpful items in the next relief bill. She has asked that states be allowed to extend basic support grant carry-over periods, waive the 15% pre-ETS requirement, and allow VR agencies to assist BEP vendors in restocking inventory during re-opening. There was a call with the RSA Commissioner on Wednesday where he was asked about when these items could become a reality and he did not have any solid information on this to share.<br>
The leadership team continues to discuss and plan for the resumption of different in-person services. A big thanks to Joyce, Cheri, and Sarah W. for their work on this. As you can imagine, it is not an easy task getting ahold of masks and hand sanitizer, but we have them on order. We are also looking at guidance put out by the CDC, state library, and private businesses to come up with best practices for folks when we are doing in person training and other services. As the crisis continues to evolve, we are adjusting and evaluating resources and options. I do wish I could be more solid and definite, but with things still changing and so much still unknown about the virus, this isn’t really possible. But here are a couple things I do know that may help in planning:<br>
At this time, we do not anticipate returning to providing in person training, counseling, or programming to clients or patrons until at least June 1.<br>
We are continuing to ask folks to come into the building only on an as needed basis. It used to be that folks worked in the building unless they had a need not to. For the time being, we are asking folks to come in only to do work that needs to be done in the building such as mail, sending out books, sending out equipment, working on the building, working on computer systems where being in physical contact with the computers is necessary, providing staff training, etc. We expect folks to follow proper cleaning, hand washing, and social distancing procedures. Please use only the 1st and 4th floor restrooms to reduce the workload of our cleaning staff.<br>
Proper Jean day attire is still allowed and will be continued until we have public visitors. <br>
We ask folks to wear masks whenever not in their own apartment or alone in their office. and especially when they are in areas others may enter or pass through. Wearing a mask is being kind to your colleagues. We have more masks on order, but there will be a box of masks in the main office for those who need them. It is a good idea to launder cloth masks before use and on a regular basis. <br>
Please continue to communicate with your supervisor regarding needs, challenges, and solutions.<br>
We will be holding our June all staff meeting via Zoom. More details will follow regarding team and divisional meetings held that week.<br>
The June ILAC meeting will be held via Zoom. We are researching if a toll free call in option will be necessary and if so how to make that happen. There will be more details to come.<br>
Center students will not return to the center until after the June all staff meeting. The infection rates being what they are and having dorms with communal bathrooms makes bringing the students back more challenging. The tentative restart date for center classes is now June 8.<br>
We are working to find ways to modify and continue LEAP this summer. We are working through various options regarding altering the start date and taking other precautions with staff and restructuring staff trainingWe know how valuable this program is to the youth we serve and most families are still wanting their children to participate. We should be able to share more details soon. </p>

<h2 id="toc_990">Team 3 Virtual CBT</h2>

<p>From Jamie: 4/28/20 Team 3 (Leland Smith, Zach Ellingson, Matt Nemmers, Jamie Phipps, and Joe Weigel) (Darren was on vacation, but he helped plan it) A virtual training was held today via Zoom to focus on self-advocacy around blindness. There were 8 participants in the training. The focus areas included: 1) how to react to negative social assumptions around blindness, 2) advocating for self, 3) view on blindness, and 4) motivation (either work or develop new hobby). Ideas were given on how to react to negative social bias. Techniques on using a helper shopper in the community while advocating for yourself. Clients were asked about their view on blindness. Finally, ways to stay motivated with your career goal or goal to maintain a hobby were discussed. Clients were able to give examples of their experiences, ask questions to staff and other clients of IDB, and bounce ideas off of each other. At the end of the training, clients reported they felt it was “enlightening”, “beneficial to hear from other clients”, and overall enjoyed the interaction. They all asked we do it again in a month with different topics to discuss. Their “homework” is to contact their counselor with training ideas so we can continue to provide this type of training with them. We plan to group 8-10 different clients next week as this seemed to be a good number for conversation virtually. Our goal is that it will turn into a monthly rotation with 3-4 different groups. </p>

<h2 id="toc_991">Team 4 Training Update</h2>

<p>From Lisa: Team 4 did another CBT last Friday about low cost meals, substitutions you can use for common food items, and apps to help with meal planning including recipes and making a grocery list from the meal planning/recipes that you picked out.<br>
We announced that our training next week will be about conquering fear. One of my clients sent me a text after the training saying that next weeks training will be a tough one for him but he will definitely be on it. He asked if our conversation last week, about the possibility of him coming to the OC, had any input on the topic for next week’s training. He also thanked me for listening and facilitating possible help for him and others as he knows he is not the only one with the issue of fear and the anxiety it can cause. I told the client that Drew was the one who came up with the idea for the next training and that it will be a great conversation as we all have some fear. I thanked him for being an active participant and that we (TEAM 4) really appreciate it. My client responded thanking us for the trainings so that he has the opportunity to participate. </p>

<h2 id="toc_992">Tech Tip: Dialing Conference Call Codes</h2>

<p>For anyone who struggles to enter the conference code into a smart phone key pad fast enough, you can type in the phone number, then type 1 or 2 commas, and then type the conference code before hitting the dial button. You can enter a comma by holding down the star key on either an iPhone or Android phone. If the number is for a conference line that you dial frequently with an access code that doesn’t change, it may be helpful to save the number and conference code separated by a comma as a contact. </p>

<h2 id="toc_996"><strong>AR: Event Tracking Help Needed</strong></h2>

<p>Every time I talk about all the great things that everyone at IDB has been working on since the beginning of this crisis, I am so excited and proud. However, it is a bit challenging to keep track of everything that is happening to make sure that we can promote and share information about events with those who need it. To help with this, we&rsquo;ve created a Wufoo to track what events are happening. We can then use this to update our website calendar, the coffee talk events list, put out Facebook or GovDeliveries, or use other methods to help folks find out about and attend these events, trainings, webinars, etc. Please complete this form when you have created such an event:</p>

<p><strong>TEAM 4 Weekly trainings Via Zoom</strong></p>

<p>From Lisa: TEAM 4 has decided to do a training every Friday at 10:00 AM on Zoom since we were not able to do our CBT in person. Our first training was this past Friday, 04/17/2020, we had twelve VR clients participate. We presented on how to get groceries/items that you need during this time, social distancing and different apps that are accessible and will keep them up to date on the COVID-19 situation in Iowa. Several of the clients gave input as to what is working for them. I met with one of my clients after the training and he is seriously thinking about coming to the OC, he has a family and is working. He also said that he is looking forward to the next training. This coming Friday we will talk about low cost meals, using the items you have in your pantry and substitutions for items that you may not have or be able to get right now</p>

<p><strong>VR Teacher Ofice Hours on Friday Afternoons</strong></p>

<p>VR Teachers will be holding office hours via Zoom to provide VR clients a time where they know they can always reach a teacher to ask questions related to their training, skills they are working on or challenges they are having at home or at work. Questions might involve travel, braille, home management, smart phones, grocery shopping etc. We will be trying this out for the time being every Friday from 2:00-3:30 PM; teachers will rotate who covers each week. Please help spread the word and the call in info below. Note that this opportunity is meant for active VR clients only.</p>

<p><strong>Director Updates</strong></p>

<p>The leadership team has been meeting regularly and having discussions wround when and how to migrate different services from their current virtual state to allow fo face to face interaction. No time frames have been set yet. We are closely monitoring guideance from the Governor&rsquo;s office and looking at what our partners and neighbors are doing. We have pushed back center classes retruning until at leat May 18th. This date may be pushed back further if circumstances don&rsquo;t make resuming in person classes advisable at that time. I&rsquo;d like to have more certain infromation to share, but these are not certain times. However, we are flexible, resilient, and committed to providing the services blind Iowans need to be gainfully employed and live independently.</p>

<p><strong>Passing of Former Staff Member</strong></p>

<p>From Sarah W.: I am sorry to have to share this news with all of you. One of our former library staff members, Karen Kemnitz passed away this weekend. I don&rsquo;t have too much information at this point. Her family is planning a private burial service held in Nebraska. I will pass on any further information that I receive. For those of you who did not know Karen, she was a reader&rsquo;s advisor for our library and after that worked in for the State mail system. She would often be the one to pick up and deliver the mail to our inside mailbox at the building. She had recently switch positions in the State and was working with the Parole Board.</p>

Director Updates</p>

<p>Hello all, there will be another report to the legislature on Monday, so please have stories, stats, or updates to me by noon. They’ve been very happy with what we have shared so far, so let’s keep it going! <br>
Thanks to all those who participated in the brainstorming session on Wednesday. We had some great ideas. I’ve put the notes below. Thanks to Janice for taking notes even though I forgot to ask her. That is a jedi level executive assistant right there :). <br>
Director’s Forum was very well attended today. I think the new time will work well. Probably having more of a captive audience might have helped also. I asked for ideas to find ways to get more tech to people, particularly how our G&amp;B fybd cab help. Beth Jordan from HKNC was there and shared about I Can Connect, which was very helpful. Sarah shared out library info and Kim shared opportunities available from the CILs. There was discussion on how to get info about IDB events like Director’s Forum out to more people. One idea that was shared with me after the call from Enrique was to use an Alexa skill. <br>
Update on LEAP</p>

<p>To let folks know, as things stand now, we are hoping to be able to hold LEAP. We all know this is an unpredictable situation we are in, but ETT folks ar working and planning away. Matt shared the below with families earlier this week:<br>
The summer conventions have all been cancelled or transitioned to virtual attendance. This means none of our students or staff will be travelling to attend a national convention this year. As a result, all students will return home from July 3 through July 11. <br>
Departures: Students will have an abbreviated schedule on July 3rd, eat lunch at the University, then begin departing in the afternoon. Parents wishing to pick up their students can do so between 2:00 and 4:00 pm on Friday. If a student is being picked up, please coordinate those arrangements with me, Matt Nemmers, so we can ensure students are prepared to leave at that time. If those times don’t work, please connect with me to make other arrangements.<br>
While students are at home: The LEAP Staff will be enjoying a week of staff enhancement training. I am personally excited to have all of our staff arrive in Des Moines and begin our summer! During the week students are home, we’ll be continuing our work on professional skills building, team development, and completing administrative tasks. This will be a valuable time for us to get reset and prepare for the second half of a great summer.<br>
Student return: Students are invited to return to campus on July 11th between 2:00 and 4:00 pm. This will allow for time to get settled in, catch up with friends, and prepare for the excitement in the week ahead! Please be sure to coordinate arrival times back to campus with me to ensure that we have staff available to greet students upon arrival.<br>
Thank you all for your patience and understanding during this unique health situation! I will continue to be in touch and provide updates regarding the upcoming LEAP Summer Program. If you have any questions regarding program offerings throughout IDB, such as LEAP, Weekend Retreats, or Self Weeks, please reach out to me and I’ll be happy to share our most up to date information with you.<br>
Please continue to stay well and I look forward to a great summer experience!<br>

Tech Tip: iPhone Zoom Settings</p>

<p>From Joe G.: At our ET team meeting yesterday, I mentioned some settings on the iPhone version of Zoom that you can set in order to make it a little easier to connect to meetings. Note that this does not cover the PC version. <br>
All of the settings mentioned are found in the meetings section, under the settings tab. I prefer to connect automatically to audio, and have video off, and my mic muted by default.<br>
Tap the “Settings” tab, then tap “Meetings”. Change the following.<br>
•Auto connect to Audio, Tap that button, and Choose “connect using Internet”<br>
•Always mute my microphone, Turn this option to on. Note that when this is checked, you must unmube the mic before talking.<br>
• Always turn off my video, Switch it to on. This will make sure that metings don’t start with video. Of course, it is easy enough to turn video on/off any time. If you use video, then don’t worry about changing this option.<br>

<p>Shout Outs</p>

<p>From Keri: Shout Out to Ashley West: The Virginia Commonwealth University WIPA National Training and Data Center, in collaboration with the Social Security Administration, have certified that Ashley successfully completed the required competency-based educational and assessment activities to be certified as a Community Partner Works Incentives Counselor. Ashley worked hard to complete all of the activities and requirements to obtain this certification (it was definitely not an easy process!). A huge congratulations to Ashley for all of the hard work and dedication she put into this training. So awesome!!<br>
From Emily: A big shout out to Janice for getting us all on track and getting out the Volunteer Newsletter in the midst of these challenging times. It’s not easy in normal time to heard the necessary cats to make this happen, so it’s really impressive right now!<br>
Director Updates</p>

<p>Sorry for the late edition this week. Friday Kim, Mark, and I worked on finishing up the first round of IL teacher interviews. If folks could check out the openings in the job openings section below an share them with folks they know who might be good fits for those positions, that would be really helpful. <br>
At 4:00 on Wednesday, if folks are interested and have supervisor clearance, you are invited to a listening and brainstorming session . Last Wednesday, the leadership team started a SOAR process around youth programming and I’d like some thoughts and feedback about some of the ideas as well as other agency initiatives. One cool idea that Cheri had was to be able to share children’s books with positive blind protagonists. I’ve done a little work on this over the weekend and want to talk about that and get other ideas. If you happen to know a children’s book illustrator who might volunteer to work on a book or books that we would get made, please let me know. <br>

There was no request for a legislative update this week, but I’m still compiling so we are ready for the next one or we can release it to the public on our own. I’m attaching last week’s edition. Thanks so much to all of you who shared all the great stories. In some areas there were so many good ones I couldn’t use them all and it became a bit of first come/first serve. So please don’t feel bad if anything you sent didn’t make it in or hasn’t been used yet. One of the things I’d like to brainstorm about is how we can best share these great stories with legislators, consumer groups, partners, and other stakeholders. <br>

<p>The Communications Team is looking to make banners that we can take to events and fairs highlighting IDB programs. We need pictures. We also need pictures for presentations and other promotional activities. There is a new place to put pictures to make this as easy as possible for folks. If you are connected via VPN, this link should work.

Resource Spotlight: Apple COVID19 App</p>

<p>From Enrique: Apple has released a portal application for COVID 19 information. This application which can be downloaded for free from the App Store is accessible. The app contains information specific to each state. The app also links to various online resources, including food assistance programs, health care assistance programs, food programs for kids grades k-12 at their local school. For example, children in my neighborhood can go to Callanan Middle school for two meals a day, breakfast and Lunch. In addition it connects users to reputable news and information regarding Covid 19. I have not found an app for Android users yet. However, Google does give a lot of information on their specific website. You can just search for Covid 19 and it gives you the most up to date info.<br>
Buy Local Means Supporting Your Local BEP Vendor!</p>

<p>From Kathy: If you are traveling or are looking for sweet and savory snacks, pop and even healthy nut and bar options and a safe shopping experience or excursion, consider supporting a blind vendor at Rest Areas, and vending at other places that are open and easy to access without crowds. Only one set of likely gloved hands has touched their products! Grub Hub is not helping them. Some accept cash and others credit cards, but your support will mean a lot! Bon apetit!<br>

<p>AR: More Stories please</p>

<p>We have another update do on Monday, so if you have stories of clients and patrons served or virtual events you’ve put together or have scheduled, please share with me by noon on Monday 4/6. I’m attaching our updates from the previous weeks. We got a lot of enthusiasm around the para educator training and the Department of Ed is going to help us promote the next session. A big thanks to those who sent stories last week. I couldn’t include them all and will be using some of them in this week’s installment. A special shout out to IL who really stepped up in this regard. This is a great opportunity to show the legislature how important what we do is and this message will be more crucial now than ever. <br>
New format for additional articles section</p>

<p>Because there have been so many updates and opportunities to share as of late, I’ve changed the format of the additional articles section.

Thank You Note</p>

<p>From Al: I want to say thank you to all of IDB for the kind words that people have sent. I am not one who particularly feels comfort from the outpouring of sympathy, but if it was absent it would be worse. It’s during these times that I become the introvert that hides inside, and, in the vernacular of the day, emotionally shelters in place. I am back to work, and I look forward to seeing you all when we can.<br>

DAS FAQ Updated</p>

<p>The full FAQ can be found at <a href="https://das.iowa.gov/human-resources">https://das.iowa.gov/human-resources</a><br>
The primary updates revolve around implementation of the FFRCA enacted on April 1. State employees can now use sick leave under the below conditions and the 40 hour cap on family care sick leave has been lifted. If you have questions, please speak with your supervisor. <br>
Added 4/2/20 Q14: What types of leave are available to employees under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)? A14: The FFCRA provides for emergency paid leave and the emergency expansion under FMLA. The FFCRA applies to six specific situations: 1. The employee is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19.   2. The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine because of COVID-19.   3. The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and is seeking a medical diagnosis.  <br>
4.  The employee is caring for an individual subject or advised to quarantine or isolation.  <br>
5.  The employee is caring for a son or daughter whose school or place of care is closed, or child care provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 precautions.  <br>
6.  The employee is experiencing substantially similar conditions as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury.  <br>
The Department of Administrative Services – Human Resources Enterprise is developing further communications and FAQs. Updated 4/2/20 Q15: Does the appointing authority have to allow parents or caregivers time off from work to care for sick family members or children who have been dismissed from school? A15: The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) was signed into law on March 18, 2020, and has an effective date of April 1, 2020. This act provides for emergency paid leave and the emergency expansion under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In addition to the FFCRA and in accordance with DAS-HRE administrative rule 63.3(11), employees may use sick leave for the care or necessary attention of immediate family members. Please note there is an admin rule waiver in place that will remove the 40 hour cap on care or necessary attention for the purposes of caring for immediate family members impacted by COVID-19. The appointing authority should grant care or necessary attention leave at the employee’s convenience, except where such leave interferes with the staffing needs of the appointing authority. Additionally, the appointing authority must abide by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as well as any applicable state laws. Managers are strongly encouraged to explore options of telework for employees prior to an employee needing to utilize leave hours. <br>
Director Updates</p>

<p>As most folks have probably already heard, the Governor and Department of Education have asked all schools to refrain from holding in-person classes through at least April 30th. The Governor shared in her press conference on Thursday, April 2, that she understands the challenges that schools have in planning and if future extensions are called for, she will attempt to let districts know two weeks in advance of that extension. School closures have been one of the metrics that we have used to determine whether or not to offer small group trainings such as center classes and small group trainings like CBTs, IL Integration, or SELF week. Because of this, we will be suspending in person center classes and other small group trainings until at least May 1st. Because of the amount of prep involved and uncertainty involved with this public health crisis, we are going to cancel the May SELF week as well at this time. We will be continuing to refrain from traveling to in person meetings and visit clients until at least the end of April as well. <br>
The health and safety of our clients, patrons, and staff is our number one concern. We do not want to carry the virus from one person to another or one household to another. . We don’t want any of our staff sick, we don’t want our staff to make each other sick, and we most definitely don’t want cfolks who are particularly vulnerable to the worst effects and outcomes at risk of getting seriously or even lif threateningly ill. I know that you all are going out as little as possible and when you do need to go out you are washing your hands, covering coughs and practicing social distancing to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy. We are going to need to keep this up even when we start providing in person services again. As the situation evolves, , new information arises, and more decisions are made we will make sure to share this information with you. If folks have questions, please feel free to ask me or your supervisor. . <br>
Also I wanted to share that our RSA liaison and former Iowan,Brian Miller is hospitalized and seriously ill from COVID19. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.<br>
IVRS Administrator David Mitchell and myself met with RSA earlier this week to complete the negotiations of our performance levels for Measureable skill gains achieved by participants in Program Years (PY) 20 and 21. This number is negotiated and evaluated on a state rather than agency level, so both agencies are evaluated together rather than separately. The fact that we will now be expected to meet these 10% higher performance levels is part of why facilitating, encouraging, and recording client measurable skill gains is so important. But the bigger reason is that acquiring the skills represented by these measures means that our clients are more employable, have greater earning capacity, and are more likely to become self-sufficient and successful. Completing education and earning certifications opens up opportunities that aren’t available otherwise and our clients need to understand and take advantage of this. <br>
New Floors!</p>

<p>From Kathy: Well, almost. When we return, the 1st floor Terrazzo, and both the 3rd and 4th floor lobby areas and restrooms look that way. They have been taken down to the bare floor and nicely coated and polished! Thanks to Randy for making it happen and everyone who sidestepped those wet floors so they could be made beautiful.<br>
The custodians have been thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing dorm rooms, classrooms and offices. This should be complete next week. Then painting of the dorms can begin. To give Santo more time to contribute, notice that 1-2 stalls are open (rather than 3-7) in the 1st floor restrooms while the building is mostly empty.<br>
BEP Receives Set Aside Approval From rSA</p>

<p>From Kathy: The Business Enterprises Program (BEP) Team is ecstatic about gaining RSA approval to accept set-aside money from vendors, which will slowly build a fund to secure opportunities for vending in the future. Many thanks to Al, Tim and Emily internally for making that possible!<br>
All Staff Meeting Dates for 2021</p>

<p>To aid in event and vacation planning, we are putting out the dates for next year’s All Staff Meetings.

<p>AR and Time Sensitive: Stories and Stats to Share With the Legislature</p>

<p>I just got another message from our legislative liaison saying that she is putting together another update. Please if you have stories about successful service provision or training you are doing, any plans for upcoming distance small group trainings, etc. that would help paint a picture of your great work to share, please email them to me by noon on Monday 3/30. They don’t have to be well-written or pretty, I will be editing them all together into a consistent narrative. Thanks much!<br>
Director Updates</p>

<p>I have to say again how appreciative I am of how well everyone has done adapting to teleworking, new processes, and new technologies. Your hard work and flexibility has made these last two weeks go so much smoother. I know there are challenges and and frustrations, but I’ve seen so much positivity and can-do spirit. The Governor talks frequently about how Iowans step up and help out and do what is needed in times of crisis. This is really true and I believe it is especially true of IDB. Thank you for working hard to keep services going in such challenging times and finding ways to offer new and innovative services that may prove beneficial even after we can all be in the same room again. <br>
Some of the things going on on the state and federal level: Last week I sent a report to our legislative liaison on IDB’s COVID19 response activities. This week, the LSA has asked us to report out on anticipated changes in federal funding streams and other logistics so we are working to get that information for them. I’ve been on bi-weekly director update calls and monitoring and sharing out info from the SEOC and Governor’s office to the leadership team. Our leadership team is meeting daily to coordinate, problem solve, and share information. We are also moving forward with strategic planning around youth services and technology. The Commissioner of RSA is hosting a conference call on Monday. There is information in the additional articles section regarding the impact of the CARES Act on people with disabilities. <br>
There are also additional articles and resources surrounding adjusting to working at home and dealing with the uncertainty and stress of the current situation in the additional articles section. I’ve been trying to be targeted in passing along the many updates and resources I am receiving from venders, CSAVR/NCSAB, the feds, etc. and am looking for ways to share things out that don’t clog everyone’s already overflowing inbox. <br>
We had a successful test of the alert Iowa system earlier this week. Janice is working through the updates people are sending. Helen, Wes, and I are meeting with the providers of the state’s new learning management system. This system will be used by state employees to take essential trainings like the required sexual harassment training as well as professional development courses. <br>
I’d like to share a paragraph from our colleague Lee Ann Russo’s retirement letter that she sent to her network on Thursday. She was a long-time leader at our sister agency IVRS. This it struck me and I thought it felt like good advice for us all:<br>
“Our work requires us to respect everyone’s strengths. It also requires that we look at people’s best selves, not their worst. As I close this chapter in my life, I hope you’ll forgive me for the times I’ve fallen short, and remember only our good times together. We’ve shared a lot of those, all of which I’ll carry with me forever.”<br>
Parking Payments</p>

<p>For those of you wondering about paying April parking, we are deferring making payments until folks are regularly back in the building. We’ll have more info once we talk about returning to our standard operational mode. <br>

Connectivity Tips</p>

<p>We recently tripled our bandwidth to improve connections to our internal resources like eForce and the H drive as well as our ability to connect to I3, HRIS, and other state systems. If your connection through FortiClient disconnects or is very slow, getting closer to your router may help. Limiting the internet usage of other devices on your home network may also help. There is a lot of internet traffic and those with slower connections or those who live in more densely populated areas seem to be having the most problems. Please continue to reach out to Craig and Wes to get suggestions to help your situation as much as possible. <br>
Reminder Please be extra careful changing your passwords and logging into your encryption.</p>

<p>Wes and Craig are still available to provide tech support as needed, but some problems can be more challenging to fix remotely.<br>

Steps for Changing passwords for IDB accounts</p>

<p>From Wes: As I have helped people over the past couple weeks, this method for changing passwords appears to work even if you inadvertently open Outlook before its ready: The longer you can wait before trying outlook, the better, but this should still work. We are still discouraging people from changing passwords at the end of the day because they are more easily forgotten.<br>
What to do:</p>

<p>Verify that you have a stable connection to IDB, either because you’re on IDB wifi, plugged into the wire in the building, or have FortiClient connected.<br>
Close all apps and folders, except for FortiClient if you’re working remote from the IDB headquarters<br>
Change your password by pressing CTRL+Alt+Delete and arrowing down to “Change Password”. You can use the Mouse after hitting CTRL+Alt+Delete, the important thing is not to use the little Windows popup when your computer thinks it’s going to expire, you must use CTRL+Alt+Delete.<br>
Fill in the Old Password, New Password, and Re-Enter New Password fields and choose “OK”.<br>
You should get the message that the password has been changed, choose “OK”. If you got an error, check you are connected to IDB headquarters and try again.<br>
Activate the Start Menu by pressing the Windows Logo Key (four little squares inside a bigger square) or choose the start button from the main Windows 10 screen near the bottom by the taskbar.<br>
You land in the Search box; please type “Shared Experience”.<br>
The first result, which should have focus, is “Shared Experience Settings”; double-click this, or press “Enter”.<br>
This causes the Settings app to open with the Shared Experiences already on the screen. JAWS users navigate this dialog with “Tab” and Shift+Tab.<br>
Look in this dialog for an option that says “Fix Now”. If you see this, activate it and enter your new password in the box that comes up.<br>
If you did not see “Fix Now”, look for an option that says “work or school account created by your IT Department” and activate that.<br>
A browser should appear.<br>
Make sure that the “Choose an Account” box shows “Work or School”. Then enter the password for that account in the password box and sign in.<br>
If the Info Bar asks for you to update the stored password, say “no”. You can say “yes” to the prompt that says “Stay Signed In?”<br>
Now you can start Outlook again. You might be prompted for the password again, and if you are, enter the new password.<br>
If not prompted for a password, the Inbox should appear momentarily.<br>
If you are prompted for the password, the inbox will appear momentarily after the password dialog goes away.<br>
If this does not seem to work, close Outlook and repeat Steps 6–14again after a brief delay.<br>
Your phone’s password can be updated as normal when the prompt appears.<br>
ICN Lines and Zoom Room Calendars</p>

<p>Our two ICN conference lines and our Zoom line each have a calendar. They are on the room list so that they can be reserved just like a meeting room. Please continue to use phone calls and Basic Zoom meetings when possible. Please use Facetime, Microsoft Teams, and other options as well for internal smaller team meetings so the ICN lines and Zoom room can be used for providing client and patron services.<br>
Reminders For those Leaving their offices to telework</p>

<p>Please remember to clear off desks and table to help the mainenance staff clean. Please take home plants if you can. * Please leave desktop computers powered on so that they will continue to run updates while you are gone. You should log out or restart, but don’t power them down. * Please remember to take home food. You don’t want to come back to moldy food.<br>

Passing of Former IDB Staff</p>

<p>Delia Clayton – who went by Dee – , former receptionist and library employee for IDB for several years passed away suddenly yesterday while living with her son in North Carolina. Funeral arrangements will be announced later. She ran the switchboard when I was a student in the center and was always kind and friendly to us students.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1002">Resource Spotlight: Free Audiobook on using Zoom</h2>

<p>From: Jonathan Mosen <a href="mailto:jonathan@mosen.org">jonathan@mosen.org</a><br>
Kia ora everyone, from a beautiful Wellington New Zealand.<br>
As many of you know, I’m now CEO of a national organisation here in New Zealand. I’m no longer developing Mosen Consulting projects, but I keep titles available as long as they remain relevant. Occasionally, I check in to see what we have sold through our automated system.<br>
Having just done this, I have noticed a sharp increase in the number of people buying my audiobook on Zoom Cloud Meetings, “Meet Me Accessibly”, which is a three-hour description of how to use Zoom on a range of platforms with a screen reader. There has been a very sharp spike in sales in just the last few days.<br>
Clearly, this is because more people are already working from home or are preparing to do so.<br>
I do not feel comfortable profiting from a need people have during a crisis that is unprecedented in living memory. If people need access to the material at a time like this, I can afford to give it away especially since Mosen Consulting is no longer my primary means of making a living.<br>
I have therefore refunded in full everyone who has purchased “Meet Me Accessibly” during March, and made it free on the website. You are welcome to download it free and distribute it anywhere you want. The only thing I ask is that you please not change any of the files and that it be distributed in full.<br>
Download it free from <a href="http://mosen.org/zoom">http://mosen.org/zoom</a><br>
I hope this helps in some small way during a very tough time for many.<br>
There is no sugar coating the fact that we are living through a very difficult period in history. But if we follow quality advice including regular handwashing and levels of isolation appropriate for the degree of outbreak in our country, we’ll get through it.<br>
Let’s all do our best to stay safe, be mindful of the safety of others, and be kind.<br>
Take care.<br>
Jonathan<br>

LEAP Weekend Retreat Update</p>

<p>This is from Helen, she did get it in to me right away last week and I let it get buried in my inbox. Sorry about that.<br>
Thank you to everyone who helped make this past weekend’s retreat a success. We had a record 21 students participate, and 6 of those students competed in the Braille Challenge. At this retreat students participated in discussions and activities related to professional dress and meal etiquette, performed a couple science experiments, played some games related to braille knowledge, explored the tables at the STEM-Fest, practiced communications skills through improv games, created some art projects, and participated in a business class discussion on actively participating in science classes in school and college led by commissioner Ryan. Reminder: the deadline for students to apply to attend LEAP this summer is March 15.<br>
Reminder: Anonymous Culture Survey</p>

<p>If you could please take a moment before EOB 3/16 and fill out the below anonymous survey to share your thoughts regarding our agency culture, I would appreciate it. I and the entire leadership team feel very strongly that we want to have a positive, professional environment. Please share solutions and ideas to help us all to continually improve. Diversity makes us stronger and listening makes us kinder and wiser. <br>

Short Updates</p>

<p>We had another director’s planning meeting Monday regarding the COVID19 virus and all agencies are planning to deal with the virus and it’s impact on our operations. We absolutely can’t stress enough that if you are feeling sick, please stay home. Also please cover coughs and sneezes and wash your hands well and often. If the spread of the virus causes us to alter our meeting schedules, scheduled events, or work locations and schedules, we will be sure to let everyone know. The situation is changing pretty quickly but we will be ready to make changes or decisions when there is a need. If you have questions, please talk to your supervisor. <br>
As you all know, we have ben working to get evacuation plans updated and building information consolidated, and an overall plan for ongoing maintenance and updates together. I apologize for the confusion around the closing off of the rec room and basement areas on Monday. There was a tear in a pipe cover that needed to be tested per regulations, however, it should have ben better planned and communicated and we will definitely be more planful and communicate fully in the future when doing materials testing. <br>
The Director’s Forum Time survey closed and the most popular time option was noon on the third Friday of the month by a fairly wide margin. So in April, I will be moving the Director’s Forum to noon on the third Friday of the month. There was also support for the update portion to be put on the web, on cartridges, and/or in a podcast, so I will be looking at ways to mmake this happen in the coming months. <br>

<p>Shout Out</p>

<p>A shout out to the library folks for being the first library in the country to reconcile machine counts through the PIMMS system. This is really cool considering there was so much doubt that we would ever be able to implement an off-the-shelf ILS and those doubters thought we’d never get it to interface with their inventory system. Way to go for once again defying the doubters!<br>
From Cheri: a big thanks to Cara for working to get a complicated tuition billl paid before the 2019 end of fiscal year closing. This extra effort helped save us time and work down the road and is much appreciated!<br>

Youth Advisory Committee Now Accepting Applications</p>

<p>In June, the Iowa Commission for the Blind approved the formation of a Youth Advisory Committee. This committee will advise IDB staff in aall areas on programs and initiatives effecting youth. We are looking for volunteers ages 14–21 to serve on this committee. We are asking folks to be willing to commit to four meetings or events a year and responding to occasional requests for input over email or text message. We are hopeful that this will help us build programs and services that are very responsive to the needs of youth while providing leadership and growth opportunities for those who serve. We will be taking applications until October 15th. If someone you know would be interested, the application can be found at : <a href="https://iowadeptblind.wufoo.com/forms/zt155s711ndfuk/">https://iowadeptblind.wufoo.com/forms/zt155s711ndfuk/</a><br>
ERC Yogurt Bar 9/13</p>

<p>From Marcella: Employee Recognition Committee (ERC) will have a yogurt bar at the staff meeting on Friday, September 13th at 8am until the staff meeting begins. We will have plain yogurt with all the toppings. Please stop by the ERC’s yogurt bar for a healthy or not breakfast. You will need to bring your own beverage.<br>
Reminder: Food Deliveries</p>

<p>If you order food, you need to meet the delivery person at the door. This is especially important if you are paying with cash or need to give a cash tip as you will risk the food being returned to the restaurant.. If pre-paid food is delivered and no one is there to receive it, it will be put on a shelf under the microwave in the break room. This is necessary as we cannot have people coming in for meetings and have our front area smelling and looking like a McDonalds. No one will be expected to monitor this shelf or ensure food is given to the correct owner. <br>
Reminder: Digital Player Inventory – We Need Your Help</p>

<p>From Sarah W: The Library has been directed by the National Library Service to conduct an inventory of the digital players. Also, as we work through our RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tagging of all or our materials and players. So we need your help. During the week of September 9th (Staff Meeting Week) please bring in any and all digital players that you have. Library staff will be available in the Assembly Room between 8:00am – 9:00am, 12:00pm – 1:00pm and 3:00pm – 4:00pm each day during the week. We will make sure your player is properly checked out in our system, apply an RFID tag and check to see what updates your player may need. The players that you use will be returned to you at that time. If you have players that you are no longer using, we would really like those back. This will ensure that we have enough in the upcoming years for our patrons. The Library is also creating an audio cartridge with Library News, that we will provide with information about library services, programs, tips and information that you can use to stay up to date and/or share with clients/patrons. We will be creating new audio updates quarterly to share. If you are unable to make it during the above times, please contact Jodi Aldini-Zepeda at <a href="mailto:jodi.aldini@blind.state.ia.us">jodi.aldini@blind.state.ia.us</a> or 515–452–1327 to schedule a time. Thank you for your help!<br>

Volunteer Opportunity</p>

<p>From Kathy:Hello Friends and Colleagues,<br>
The Walnut Creek YMCA desires to strengthen the community by offering an ELL class and seeks volunteers who would like to be trained to be instructors. My friend, Christine Comito, is on the board and I happily agreed to pass the opportunity along! Please see details below and share with anyone you know who may have interest? <br>
This one 2-session ELL instructor training is Friday, September 6, 6–8:30 pm and Saturday, September 7, 8 am–1:00 pm. <br>
Tidbit if you are new to this field: ESL and ELL are often used interchangeably. They stand for English as a Second Language and English Language Learners, respectfully. From a teaching perspective, they refer to the same thing—English learning. ELL recognizes that for many individuals, English is their next language to learn as they may already be fluent in multiple other languages. There is a flyer attached with more information.<br>
